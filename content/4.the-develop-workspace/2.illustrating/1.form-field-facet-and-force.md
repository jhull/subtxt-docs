title: "Form, Field, Facet, and Force"
description: Identifying the source of conflict within a perspective
---

The **Form-Field-Facet-Force** framework provides a structured approach to identifying the **source of conflict** within a given **Perspective** in a narrative. By shifting from **Form** to **Force**, this method moves beyond biased categories like **Domain, Concern, Issue, and Problem** and allows for a more intentional exploration of **why conflict arises** in a given context.

Instead of relying on pre-defined objects that may conflict in purpose, **Form → Field → Facet → Force** presents a more intentional, layered approach to uncovering the **source of inequity.** These are still **structural categories**, but rather than being imposed from the outside (as fixed labels), they emerge **organically** from the way conflict functions in a story. This method ensures that structure remains **a tool for discovery**, not just a system for classification.

This approach provides **sub-layers of subtext**, ensuring a deeper understanding of narrative conflict by examining **how inequities manifest and persist** across different scales of perception.

## **1. Establish the Perspective of Conflict**  
Before determining **how** conflict is structured within a narrative, we must first establish **from where it is observed**. Every conflict exists within a **Perspective**, which frames the nature of the tension and the way it is experienced.  

These four **Perspectives** define the **point of observation** in relation to the conflict:  

- **I** → The **personal experience** of conflict. This is the perspective of direct involvement, where the tension is felt **from within**.  
- **You** → The **externalized experience** of conflict. This perspective observes and interacts with another both directly and indirectly.
- **We** → The **bonded experience** of conflict. This perspective appreciates the ebb and flow and space _between_ a unified dynamic.
- **They** → The **detached experience** of conflict. This perspective operates at a distance, observing how conflict unfolds externally without direct participation.  

By defining the **Perspective**, we determine and color the **scope of engagement with the conflict** before moving into the **Form, Field, Facet, and Force** that shape it.  

---

## **2. Find the Form**  
**(External, Internal, Framing, Processing)**  

The first step in **Finding a Source of Conflict** is determining the **Form** through which conflict is perceived. This is akin to identifying the general **nature of the problem** before understanding its deeper layers. A perspective projects an appreciation of conflict across four primary Forms:

- **External:** Conflict that arises outside the mind—tangible, observable conflicts such as physical actions, external threats, or environmental influences.  
- **Internal:** Conflict that arises inside the mind—subjective struggles such as personal doubts, emotional turmoil, or psychological burdens.  
- **Framing:** Conflict that is perceived as **static**—the way a situation or a prejudice is structured, defined, or positioned in a fixed state.  
- **Processing:** Conflict that is perceived as **a process**—the way activities and dysfunctional ways of thinking are navigated, interpreted, or resolved over time.  

This stage ensures that the **lens of the narrative** is correctly set before narrowing the focus.

---

## **3. Narrow the Field**  
**(Foundational, Functional, Latent, Deliberative)**  

Once the Form is established, we refine the **Field**—the general scope or magnitude of the conflict within that Form. These Fields define the **narrative landscape** where conflict exists:

- **Foundational →** Conflict rooted in **fundamental principles, structures, and existential tensions.**  
  - Represents deep-seated forces that form the bedrock of the narrative field.  
  - Example: _A society built on systemic inequality, where every interaction stems from that foundational tension._  

- **Functional →** Conflict that **emerges from execution, operation, and interaction within a system.**  
  - Examines whether something **works or fails** based on its inherent properties.  
  - Example: _A scientist trying to perfect a new technology but constantly encountering flaws in the system._ 

- **Latent →** Conflict that **emerges, develops, and reveals potential change.**  
  - Represents forces that are **unrealized, forming, or influencing transformation from beneath the surface.**  
  - Example: _A young woman sensing an unspoken shift in societal expectations, navigating the tension between who she is and who she is becoming._ 

- **Deliberative →** Conflict that **arises from active mental evaluation, strategy, and decision-making.**  
  - Engages with **doubt, analysis, appraisal, and determining what is possible or allowed in the moment.**  
  - Example: _A consul deliberating over a new governor incites assumptions and prejudice in reaching their final decision._

| **Field**      | **Definition** | **Mapped Story Elements** |
|--------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| **Foundational** | The established forces that shape the bedrock of conflict. | **Past, Understanding, Conceptualizing, Memory** |
| **Latent** | The emerging, potential, and developing aspects of conflict. | **Future, Obtaining, Becoming, Subconscious** |
| **Functional** | The operational forces that determine how conflict moves and interacts. | **Progress, Doing, Being, Preconscious** |
| **Deliberative** | The forces that assess, strategize, and determine what is possible. | **Present, Learning, Conceiving, Conscious** |

This structure **maintains cohesion** while ensuring **each Field naturally aligns with the story elements it governs**.  

By refining the Field, we establish **the terrain of the conflict**—whether it is deeply ingrained, pushing outward, struggling to function, or caught in the tension of real-time analysis.

## **4. Explore a Facet**  
**(Skill, Experience, Self Interest, Sense of Self, etc.)**  

The **Facet** represents the **specific range or dimension** of the conflict within the Field. This step allows for a precise articulation of **where** the source of tension exists.

Examples of possible Facets:
- **Skill:** The conflict revolves around proficiency, training, or mastery.  
- **Experience:** The conflict stems from past events, lessons learned, or accumulated wisdom.  
- **Self Interest:** The conflict arises from a focus on personal gain and self above all others.  
- **Sense of Self:** The conflict is shaped by an over-inflated ego or a projection of self that conflicts with reality.  

This step ensures that we are **defining the parameters of the conflict within its landscape**, clarifying how it interacts with the surrounding conditions and why it persists.

## **5. Identify the Force**  
At the deepest level, we uncover the **Force**—but unlike previous steps, this is where the **elusive nature of inequity** fully reveals itself. An inequity cannot be reduced to a singular cause, and if forced into a single entity, the entire system collapses.  

Instead, the **Force** splits into **four sub-forces**, which attempt to approximate the nature of the imbalance:  

- **Problem, Solution, Focus, and Direction**  
- **Condition, Adjustment, Resistance, and Flow**  

Each set of labels is simply **another attempt to appreciate the inherently indescribable nature of inequity**. These forces are not separate elements but rather **different ways of perceiving the imperceivable**, forcing the observer to inevitably loop back into another attempt at **Forming an appreciation of inequity.**  

### **Why Stop Here?**  
This **looping obliterates the original Perspective**—meaning itself is lost when the force is broken down further. To preserve a coherent understanding, we **hold everything within a Perspective** by stopping at the **Form, Field, Facet, and Force** level—leaving the sub-forces as a stop-gap and means by which to stabilize a narrative.

This Form, Field, Face, and Force framework **drills down into the dynamic interplay of forces that sustain conflict—without collapsing into an oversimplified, singular explanation** that would eventually lose all meaning and appreciable value.

## **An Evolution of Structural Categories**
Rather than discarding structure, this approach **redefines the structuring of conflict** in a way that better aligns with the true nature of inequity in a narrative.

Instead of asking, **"What category does this conflict fall into?"**, we ask:
- **From what Perspective is the conflict being observed?** (I, You, We, They)  
- **How is the conflict being framed?** (Form)  
- **What is its scale and depth?** (Field)  
- **Where does it manifest specifically?** (Facet)  
- **What is truly driving the imbalance?** (Force)

With a set of **four sub-forces** making it possible for us to approximate and define how the very finite relates back to the very general.  

By layering **Perspective** into **Form → Field → Facet → Force**, we ensure that the source of conflict is **not just categorized but fully understood**, making it more **applicable to AI-driven narrative generation and real-world storytelling.**
