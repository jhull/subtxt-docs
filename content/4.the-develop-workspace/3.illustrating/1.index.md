description: Turning your Storyform into engaging storytelling
---

Illustrating is where you transform the thematic elements of a Storyform into Storytelling for your Audience. No one wants to hear or be told the Storyform (e.g., preached to, or beaten over the head with Theme). This is the stage where you layer on Storytelling that surfaces the subtext contained in the Storyform.

## Using Muse to Develop Storypoints or Storybeats

As a writer, you know that developing your story's plot, characters, and themes can be a daunting task. Fortunately, Subtxt is here to help you with that. With the help of Muse, our AI writing assistant, you can explore your story in new and exciting ways, uncovering insights and ideas that you might not have considered before.

One of the most useful features of Subtxt is the ability to develop Storypoints or Storybeats using Muse. If you're struggling with a particular aspect of your story, simply ask Muse to Explain it to you by tapping the Explain button near the top of either the Storypoint or the Storybeat. At the bottom of the explanation, you'll see a button marked "Develop". By tapping this button, you'll start a new conversation with Muse focused specifically on that part of your story.

Subtxt will automatically title the conversation based on the part of the Storyform you're working on, and provide Muse with information about your story to kick off the discussion. From there, you can work on the Storypoint or Storybeat in detail, brainstorming ideas, exploring different possibilities, and getting feedback from Muse along the way.

Once you're satisfied with your work, you can easily copy the information from the conversation back into your story, incorporating your new ideas and insights seamlessly. With this feature, you can develop your story in new and exciting ways, unlocking your creativity and taking your writing to the next level.

In summary, using Muse to develop Storypoints or Storybeats is an incredibly useful feature of Subtxt. By tapping the "Develop" button at the bottom of a Storypoint or Storybeat explanation, you can start a new conversation with Muse focused specifically on that part of your story. From there, you can explore new ideas and get feedback from Muse, helping you to create a richer, more complex story that your audience will love.
