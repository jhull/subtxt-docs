After illustrating Storypoints and Storybeats, the next step is Plotting the various strands of your narrative into a cohesive story. Imagine that the work you've done Illustrating the Four Throughlines has left you with four distinct threads: your job now is to _weave_ those threads together into a tapestry of Moments.

Plotting is the act of weaving Storybeats into a format readily accepted by others. Audiences do not watch a film or read a book for a Storyform or Storybeats; they expect Scenes and Chapters and Acts. Plotting is where you do this work in preparation for the writing process.  

The Plotting stage is your first major step from _storyforming_ into _storytelling_. This is where you take all the hard work you've done considering and illustrating the deep thematic aspects of your narrative, and start to bring them to life for your audience.
