Writing with Subtxt is about transforming your story ideas into a coherent and engaging narrative. While Subtxt and Muse help you develop Storybeats and a solid Storyform, the actual writing process takes place outside these tools. Readers don't engage with Storybeats or Storyforms; they expect Chapters, Scenes, and Acts. Writing is where you take the foundation built in Subtxt and craft it into a format that your audience will enjoy, whether it's a novel, screenplay, or any other form of storytelling.
