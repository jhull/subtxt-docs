## Global and Perspective-Based Narrative Agents  

### **Global Narrative Agents**  

Global Agents are accessible directly from the **Forming**, **Illustrating**, and **Plotting** tabs in the main workspace. These agents function independently of any set Perspective, allowing you to make sweeping, story-wide changes without additional setup.  

### **Perspective-Based Narrative Agents**  

Agents that require a Perspective to be set are available within specific sections of the Develop Workspace. You can access them by tapping the **Narrative Agents** button (three-line icon) in the upper-right corner of the individual section pages. These agents generate results tailored to the selected Throughline, ensuring precise and contextually relevant output.

## Accessing Narrative Agents  

To access Narrative Agents, navigate to the **Develop Workspace**. Depending on the type of Agent you need:  
- Use **Global Agents** directly within the **Forming**, **Illustrating**, or **Plotting** tabs.  
- For Perspective-based Agents, open the **Narrative Agents** menu in the upper-right corner of the section page.  

Each task sent to the **Subtxt render farm** undergoes multiple passes through advanced AI models, ensuring that every element of your story is structured effectively and aligns with your vision.

## Agent Progress Bar  

The **Agent Progress** bar, accessible through the Narrative Agents dropdown menu, helps you visualize your progress. Toggle it on or off to stay on track with key story development steps.

## Available Narrative Agents  

### **Global Narrative Agents**  

Accessible on the main section tabs:  
- **Generate Four Throughlines**: Automatically define the Objective Story, Main Character, Influence Character, and Relationship Story Throughlines.  
- **Generate Plot & Players**: Quickly build plot and characters in one step, combining structural and motivational elements.  

### **Perspective-Based Narrative Agents**  

Accessible via the Narrative Agents menu within individual section pages:  

#### **Forming Section**  

- **Generate Players**: Define key characters, such as the Protagonist and Antagonist, focusing on their **Motivations** and **Roles**.  
- **Generate Media Cues**: Bring your Players to life with visual and auditory descriptions for a [**dynamic cast experience**](/narrative-aspects/players#generating-media-cues).  

#### **Illustrating Section**  

- **Generate Storybeats**: Craft a sequence of Storybeats, aligning story structure with thematic and emotional goals.

## Setting Perspectives: A Critical Step  

For Perspective-based Agents, setting a **Perspective** is essential. Without a Perspective, the agents cannot activate, as this step provides context and direction for the story creation process.

  The Generating Storybeats feature empowers you to craft a complete thematic roadmap for your story. By selecting a Perspective within a Throughline, Subtxt analyzes key structural elements—such as Story Drivers, Goals, and Player motivations—and generates a sequence of beats that connect structure to storytelling.
