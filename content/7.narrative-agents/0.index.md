## Setting Perspectives: A Critical Step  

Before using any Narrative Agent, ensure you have a **Perspective** selected in the Throughline you’re working on. This step is essential, as it informs the agents about the type of story and context they should follow. Without a set Perspective, the agents cannot activate.

  The Generating Storybeats feature empowers you to craft a complete thematic roadmap for your story. By selecting a Perspective within a Throughline, Subtxt analyzes key structural elements—such as Story Drivers, Goals, and Player motivations—and generates a sequence of beats that connect structure to storytelling.
