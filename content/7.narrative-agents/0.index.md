## Setting Perspectives: A Critical Step  

Before using any Narrative Agent, ensure you have a **Perspective** selected in the Throughline you’re working on. This step is essential, as it informs the agents about the type of story and context they should follow. Without a set Perspective, the agents cannot activate.
