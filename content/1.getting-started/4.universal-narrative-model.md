title: Universal Narrative Model
description: A standardized framework for structuring stories, ensuring consistency and adaptability across different storytelling mediums.
---

The **Universal Narrative Model (UNM)** is an open, application-agnostic framework for structuring stories in a way that ensures consistency, adaptability, and interoperability across different mediums. Whether crafting a screenplay, novel, interactive experience, or AI-generated narrative, the model provides a common language for defining story elements.  

At its core, the UNM is a transportable Storyform—a narrative blueprint that can be carried across different formats and platforms. This flexibility allows storytellers to adapt their work while maintaining a universal standard for narrative structure. By adopting the UNM, creators have a consistent framework that fosters collaboration and ensures that the essence of the author's original intent remains intact.

### Why It Matters  

✅ **Consistency Across Mediums**  
The UNM preserves a narrative's core structure regardless of format. Whether adapted into a novel, screenplay, or game, the original vision remains intact.  

✅ **Interoperability**  
Built on a shared data format, the UNM standardizes storytelling elements across tools and platforms, enabling seamless exchange and collaboration.  

✅ **Clarity in Story Development**  
By organizing key elements—perspectives, character motivations, beats, and dynamics—into a structured yet flexible blueprint, the UNM simplifies the creative process and enhances audience engagement.  

✅ **Balance Between Theory and Practice**  
Developed through extensive hands-on experience with narrative theory, the UNM provides a structured approach that remains practical for real-world storytelling.  

✅ **AI-Assisted Storytelling**  
The UNM integrates smoothly with AI storytelling tools, ensuring coherent outputs while leaving room for human creativity and artistic freedom.

### How Subtxt Uses the Universal Narrative Model  

Subtxt helped pioneer the Universal Narrative Model, offering it as a voluntary industry standard for structured storytelling. While Subtxt integrates and expands upon this framework, it remains open for adoption by other tools, creators, and AI-driven storytelling platforms.  

By distinguishing between **Subtext** (deep narrative meaning) and **Storytelling** (surface-level audience experience), Subtxt ensures that narratives retain both authorial intent and presentation flexibility, making them adaptable across multiple mediums.

## Key Features of the Model  

### Structured Storytelling  
The Universal Narrative Model divides a **narrative** into two essential layers:  

1. **Subtext** – The **deep structure** of the story that conveys the author's intent, including:  
    - **Perspectives** – The lens through which the audience experiences the story.  
    - **Players** – Characters and their narrative functions.  
    - **Storypoints** – Core structural elements defining conflict and progression.  
    - **Storybeats** – Significant turning points within the narrative’s structure.  
    - **Dynamics** – High-level narrative forces like **Story Outcome** and **Story Judgment**.  
2. **Storytelling** – The **high-level audience experience**, focusing on how the story is told, including:  
   - **Overviews** – Surface-level elements such as the **Logline** and **Genre Dynamics**.  
   - **Moments** – Structural organizing units (e.g., **Scenes, Acts, Sequences, Chapters**) that define how the narrative unfolds.  

By keeping **Subtext and Storytelling distinct**, the model allows for **meaningful analysis** while maintaining **flexibility in execution**.

### Standardized Format 
The **Universal Narrative Model JSON Schema** provides a **consistent, machine-readable** way to define and structure stories.  
- **Ensures compatibility** across tools and platforms.  
- **Facilitates validation** using JSON Schema standards.  
- **Supports AI-driven story generation** while retaining human intent.  

---

### Extensibility 
The framework is **designed for flexibility**, allowing users to **expand beyond the standard model** through:  
- **Custom Appreciations & Methods** – Define unique narrative elements while mapping to the core schema.  
- **Namespaced Extensions** – Maintain compatibility across frameworks like **Dramatica, Hero’s Journey, and Save the Cat!**  
- **Custom Storytelling Elements** – Add unique categories in **Overviews & Moments** without breaking structural integrity.  

---

### Versioning & Backward Compatibility  
- Each update is **versioned** to maintain compatibility.  
- Deprecated elements are **tracked** to support legacy integrations.  
- Future iterations ensure **long-term stability** while improving adaptability.
