title: Universal Narrative Model
description: A standardized framework for structuring stories, ensuring consistency and adaptability across different storytelling mediums.
---

The **Universal Narrative Model** is an **open, application-agnostic framework** for structuring stories in a way that ensures **consistency, adaptability, and interoperability** across different mediums. Whether crafting a screenplay, novel, interactive experience, or AI-generated narrative, this model provides a **common language** for defining story elements.

At its core, the UNM is a **transportable Storyform**—a narrative blueprint that can be seamlessly carried across different formats and platforms. This transportability not only allows storytellers to adapt the model to suit various mediums but also establishes a **universal standard** for narrative structure. By adopting the UNM, creators have a consistent framework to follow, fostering collaboration and ensuring that the essence of the author's original intent remains intact regardless of the medium.

### **Why It Matters**

✅ **Consistency Across Mediums**  
The UNM acts as a transportable Storyform, preserving a narrative's core structure no matter the medium. Whether adapted to a novel, screenplay, or game, the original vision remains intact.

✅ **Interoperability**  
Built on a shared data format, the UNM standardizes storytelling elements across various tools and platforms. This universal approach enables seamless exchange and collaboration.

✅ **Clarity in Story Development**  
The UNM organizes key elements—perspectives, character motivations, beats, and dynamics—into a clear yet flexible blueprint. This simplifies narrative development and enhances reader engagement.

✅ **AI-Assisted Storytelling**  
By providing a structured framework, the UNM integrates easily with AI storytelling tools, ensuring coherent outputs. At the same time, it leaves room for human creativity, balancing technology with artistic freedom.

### **How Subtxt Uses the Universal Narrative Model**  
Subtxt helped pioneer the **Universal Narrative Model**, offering it as a **voluntary industry standard** for structured storytelling. While Subtxt integrates and expands upon this framework, it remains open for adoption by **other tools, creators, and AI-driven storytelling platforms**.  

By separating **Subtext (deep narrative meaning) from Storytelling (surface-level audience experience)**, Subtxt ensures that narratives retain **both authorial intent and presentation flexibility**, making them adaptable across **novels, screenplays, interactive experiences, and AI-generated narratives**.

## Key Features of the Model  

### Structured Storytelling  
The Universal Narrative Model divides a **narrative** into two essential layers:  

1. **Subtext** – The **deep structure** of the story that conveys the author's intent, including:  
    - **Perspectives** – The lens through which the audience experiences the story.  
    - **Players** – Characters and their narrative functions.  
    - **Storypoints** – Core structural elements defining conflict and progression.  
    - **Storybeats** – Significant turning points within the narrative’s structure.  
    - **Dynamics** – High-level narrative forces like **Story Outcome** and **Story Judgment**.  
2. **Storytelling** – The **high-level audience experience**, focusing on how the story is told, including:  
   - **Overviews** – Surface-level elements such as the **Logline** and **Genre Dynamics**.  
   - **Moments** – Structural organizing units (e.g., **Scenes, Acts, Sequences, Chapters**) that define how the narrative unfolds.  

By keeping **Subtext and Storytelling distinct**, the model allows for **meaningful analysis** while maintaining **flexibility in execution**.

### Standardized Format 
The **Universal Narrative Model JSON Schema** provides a **consistent, machine-readable** way to define and structure stories.  
- **Ensures compatibility** across tools and platforms.  
- **Facilitates validation** using JSON Schema standards.  
- **Supports AI-driven story generation** while retaining human intent.  

---

### Extensibility 
The framework is **designed for flexibility**, allowing users to **expand beyond the standard model** through:  
- **Custom Appreciations & Methods** – Define unique narrative elements while mapping to the core schema.  
- **Namespaced Extensions** – Maintain compatibility across frameworks like **Dramatica, Hero’s Journey, and Save the Cat!**  
- **Custom Storytelling Elements** – Add unique categories in **Overviews & Moments** without breaking structural integrity.  

---

### Versioning & Backward Compatibility  
- Each update is **versioned** to maintain compatibility.  
- Deprecated elements are **tracked** to support legacy integrations.  
- Future iterations ensure **long-term stability** while improving adaptability.
