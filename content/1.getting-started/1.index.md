# Meet Subtxt

Hey there! üëã I'd love to introduce you to Subtxt, a unique platform designed to **nurture your storytelling and amplify your creative writing process**. It's not an auto-story generator; rather, think of it as a seasoned mentor guiding you on the artful journey of crafting a fully rounded story.

Subtxt with Muse is even better: **Muse allows storytellers to ‚Äúthink‚Äù their story into existence.** No more worrying about where to place ideas or how they fit into your narrative structure. Muse effortlessly organizes your thoughts and ideas in all the right places, freeing you up to focus on what truly matters‚Äîyour story. This way, the busywork is handled, and your creative energy is dedicated entirely to the craft of storytelling.

Don‚Äôt get us wrong‚ÄîSubtxt with Muse isn‚Äôt going to write your story for you. Strange confession, isn‚Äôt it, given all the hype around artificial intelligence? Instead, Subtxt with Muse will challenge you, pushing you to dig deeper into the ‚Äòwhys‚Äô and ‚Äòwhats‚Äô of your writing. What‚Äôs the message you‚Äôre trying to convey? Why is this story important to you? This thoughtful introspection is what makes the writing process all the more rewarding.

The only thing that Subtxt "generates" is a rich and meaningful outline. This outline is your golden ticket to hop into your preferred writing software and let your words dance across the screen, painting your story.

## Getting Started

If you‚Äôre new here, don‚Äôt worry‚Äîwe‚Äôve got you covered with this step-by-step guide. Subtxt is designed to help you dive deep into the storyforming process, whether you're starting from scratch or developing an existing idea. Let‚Äôs get started!

---

### Step 1: Dive Into Muse

Begin your journey in the **Muse Workspace**. Here, you can:
- **Jump into exploring your ideas**: Muse is your creative companion, ready to brainstorm and refine with you. Think of it as a co-writer that evolves with your story.
  - "I want to write a story about two elves ..."
  - "Take the narrative structure of Hamlet, but let's set it in early 18th century Phillipines."
- **Ask Muse to help you find your storyform**: Prompt Muse with questions like:
  - ‚ÄúCan you guide me through the Storyforming process?‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúWhat are the Four Throughlines of my story?‚Äù

**The Storyform is the foundation of your story's underlying theme**, acting as a framework that ensures every narrative element works together seamlessly. In Subtxt, the Storyform unlocks insights into your story's structure and meaning, helping you craft a compelling and cohesive narrative. It‚Äôs the key to understanding how your characters, plot, and themes interconnect to express a deeper message.

Muse will work with you step-by-step to shape your Storyform. Once your storyform is "finalized," you'll have access to it in two main workspaces:
1. **The Muse Workspace**
2. **The Develop Workspace**

---

### Step 2: Navigating the Muse Workspace

The **Muse Workspace** is where you‚Äôll spend most of your initial time. Here‚Äôs how to use it effectively:
- **Access your Storyform**:
  - Whether on desktop or mobile, tap the dropdown menu in the upper right to display the current context of your conversation with Muse. This will be separated out into three graudally increasing refined contexts:
    - the current Story
    - the current Storyform
    - the current Conversation
    
  Clicking on any of these takes you directly to that context.

A single Story can have multiple Storyforms (e.g _Jerry Maguire_, _Barbie_, etc.)
::

- **Continue building your storyform**: Ask Muse specific questions or request guidance, such as:
  - ‚ÄúCan we refine the Catalyst Provocateur Focus and Direction?‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúWhat does a Relationship Story Benchmark look like in my story?‚Äù
- **Save your ideas thoughtfully**: When you develop new concepts, tell Muse to save them. You can choose to save ideas to your "Storyform" for structured development or to your "Story" if you‚Äôre still exploring possibilities. 
  - This flexibility allows you to experiment without committing to a specific storyform prematurely.

Saving your ideas ensures they‚Äôre always accessible in the Muse Workspace and ready for deeper exploration in the **Develop Workspace**.

---

### Step 3: Moving to the Develop Workspace

When you‚Äôre ready to dig deeper, head to the **Develop Workspace**. You can access it by:
- Clicking the ‚ÄúDevelop‚Äù button on the Muse Workspace Storyform page.
- Selecting ‚ÄúDevelop‚Äù from your stories listing page.

The Develop Workspace is structured to guide you through four major steps:

1. **Forming**
   - This is where you build the foundation of your story by completing the essential parts of your storyform. Think of it as setting up your narrative‚Äôs blueprint.

2. **Illustrating**
   - Access every available Storypoint and Storybeat. Here, you can ask Muse to help refine the subtext behind your narrative choices, ensuring depth and meaning throughout your story.

3. **Plotting**
   - Begin organizing your storyform elements into "Moments" on a timeline. This stage focuses on translating your structure into a clear and cohesive sequence of events.

4. **Writing**
   - Do a final pass to ensure all storytelling elements align. Once complete, you can export your detailed **Subtxt Treatment** into a format compatible with your favorite writing app.

No matter where you are in the process, you can always reach out to Muse and ask it to "read back" your current draft, or to list out all the work you've done so far. From there you can always copy directly from Muse and paste into your writing app to get back to what you love doing most.

### Flexibility to Suit Your Creative Approach

Remember, you don‚Äôt need to fill out every single item in Subtxt to get value from the storyforming process and exploration. In fact, many professional writers stop after identifying their Four Throughlines and dive straight into writing! 

Subtxt is designed to adapt to your creative style. If inspiration strikes, feel free to pause, start writing, and return to Subtxt whenever you need. You can even upload a draft later and have Muse provide insightful pointers to guide you further.

The goal is to bring a little bit of order to the often chaotic world of writing. Finding your balance with Subtxt is as much a personal journey as it is a journey for the characters you create. So, take your time, explore, and enjoy the process!
