# Meet Subtxt

Hey there! üëã I'd love to introduce you to Subtxt, a unique platform designed to **nurture your storytelling and amplify your creative writing process**. It's not an auto-story generator; rather, think of it as a seasoned mentor guiding you on the artful journey of crafting a fully rounded story.

Subtxt with Muse is even better: **Muse allows storytellers to ‚Äúthink‚Äù their story into existence.** No more worrying about where to place ideas or how they fit into your narrative structure. Muse effortlessly organizes your thoughts and ideas in all the right places, freeing you up to focus on what truly matters‚Äîyour story. This way, the busywork is handled, and your creative energy is dedicated entirely to the craft of storytelling.

Don‚Äôt get us wrong‚ÄîSubtxt with Muse isn‚Äôt going to write your story for you. Strange confession, isn‚Äôt it, given all the hype around artificial intelligence? Instead, Subtxt with Muse will challenge you, pushing you to dig deeper into the ‚Äòwhys‚Äô and ‚Äòwhats‚Äô of your writing. What‚Äôs the message you‚Äôre trying to convey? Why is this story important to you? This thoughtful introspection is what makes the writing process all the more rewarding.

The only thing that Subtxt "generates" is a rich and meaningful outline. This outline is your golden ticket to hop into your preferred writing software and let your words dance across the screen, painting your story.
