Subtxt is here to guide you no matter where you are in your storytelling journey. Whether you're starting with a spark of inspiration, refining a draft, or exploring deeper themes, here's how you can make the most of Subtxt and its powerful tools.

## **Starting with Just Ideas**

Have some ideas but unsure where to begin? Open up **Muse** and let your creativity flow! Start by writing down whatever comes to mind—no need to overthink or structure it. Muse is designed to work alongside you, identifying patterns and themes to help uncover the unique **Storyform** of your story.

As Muse pinpoints your story’s underlying structure, you’ll gain insights into its core dynamics. From there, you can refine your ideas, flesh out your characters, and ensure your narrative feels cohesive. Subtxt makes sure your creative exploration leads to a fully realized and complete story. So go ahead—let your imagination take the lead!

## **Refining a Draft**

Already have a draft and a general structure in mind? Subtxt can help you take it to the next level. Upload your draft into Subtxt, aligning it with the context of a **Storyform**. With this connection, **Muse** will analyze your draft, pinpointing gaps or areas where key story elements might be missing.

This process ensures that your draft aligns with the underlying principles of a strong narrative. Whether it’s missing storybeats, underdeveloped characters, or unclear throughlines, Subtxt gives you actionable insights to polish your story and make it shine.

## **Brainstorming with Inspiration**

If you’re in the brainstorming phase and looking for a spark of inspiration, Subtxt’s tools are perfect for getting started. You can select a **Storyform** inspired by a favorite film or novel—something that resonates with the tone or theme you want to explore. From there, use that structure as a foundation to start generating ideas for your new story.

By borrowing from an established story’s framework, you can experiment and let Muse guide you into creating something entirely your own. With every idea, Muse keeps your thoughts organized, helping you shape your vision into a new and exciting narrative.

## **Exploring Story Themes**

Once you’ve identified your **Storyform**, head over to the **Develop Workspace** to dive deeper into your story’s meaning and themes. Here, you can explore the intricacies of **Storypoints** and **Storybeats**—the building blocks of your narrative. With **SubtxtAI**, you’ll have the chance to learn about and refine every aspect of your story.

Want feedback on your work? Use **ReviewAI** to have Subtxt evaluate your story’s components, offering suggestions for improvement and ensuring every element supports the greater theme. Whether you’re solidifying character motivations or fine-tuning plot progressions, Subtxt helps you elevate your story to new heights.
