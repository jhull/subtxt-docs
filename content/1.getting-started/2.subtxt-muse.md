## Think Your Story into Existence

**Subtxt Muse** is your always-on, super-intelligent AI writing companion, designed to help you *think* your story into existence. By simply sharing your ideas—whether it's a single concept, a thematic exploration, or an entire first act—Muse will capture, organize, and shape those thoughts into meaningful and structured narrative elements, ensuring that your creativity is seamlessly saved into Subtxt's Narrative Framework.

With Muse, you're not just jotting down ideas; you're *building* a story. Think of it like working alongside a master storyteller—someone who understands your intent and helps refine your vision as you go. Whether you're brainstorming or refining, Muse will progressively guide you from an initial idea to a fully realized narrative.

## A Vision of the Future: Creating Stories as Easily as You Can Speak Them

Imagine sitting down to develop a new story and having a tool that instantly picks up on your intentions. You can start throwing out ideas, and Muse will help form them into the narrative structure required to craft a compelling and thematically rich story. It's like having a virtual "writer's room" where the more you contribute, the better Muse helps shape and evolve your work.

In HBO’s _Westworld_, the protagonist works at a futuristic game company where stories are built on the fly through dynamic collaboration with advanced tools. While Muse may not be creating expansive game worlds, it offers a similar experience for writers—helping you quickly shape and refine your ideas into fully realized stories.
