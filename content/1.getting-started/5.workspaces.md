Subtxt provides two distinct spaces for engaging with your story: the **Muse Workspace** and the **Develop Workspace**. Each workspace serves a unique purpose, allowing you to approach storytelling from both a creative and a structured perspective.  

- The **Muse Workspace** is designed for brainstorming, exploring ideas, and generating new content. It maximizes screen space for freeform exploration and creative discovery.  
- The **Develop Workspace** offers a structured environment for diving deeper into narrative concepts, organizing story elements, and refining key details.  

These spaces are interconnected, enabling you to move seamlessly between creative exploration and focused development. For example, the "pop-up" version of Muse within the Develop Workspace maintains context for the Storyform currently being explored, ensuring consistency and continuity.

### Muse and the Develop Workspace  

While Muse *can* see what’s in the Develop Workspace, the interaction isn’t fully dynamic yet. Specifically:  

- Changes made in Muse won’t appear immediately in the Develop Workspace unless you manually refresh the app.  
- However, Muse is aware of changes you make in the Develop Workspace and will adapt its responses based on those updates.  

This is a current limitation we’re actively working on and hope to have addressed by early 2025.

### Synchronizing Develop Workspace with Muse  

Your workaround—having Muse create items so it can see them—is creative but not the standard workflow. For the best experience:  

- Use the Develop Workspace for creating and managing structural elements like Perspectives and Dynamics.  
- Continue to use Muse for generating and brainstorming new content, keeping in mind its current limitations regarding dynamic updates.
