Muse Personas allow you to create personalized AI assistants that can guide and support different aspects of your story development. Whether you want a more structured approach to narrative theory or a creative companion focused solely on storytelling, Muse Personas provide a flexible toolset to match your workflow.

## What are Muse Personas?

Muse Personas are customizable AI helpers designed to enhance your storytelling process. Each Persona can be fine-tuned to assist you in different phases of your story's development, from brainstorming new ideas to refining complex narrative structures. With their unique personalities and specialized instructions, Personas can help keep your creative journey engaging and focused.

With the ability to create multiple Personas, you can switch between them depending on your current creative focus. Whether you're working on high-level world-building or refining a specific character, your Personas can be there to assist in any phase of story development.

## Activating and Managing Muse Personas

To use Muse Personas, you'll access them through the **Muse Extensions** menu, allowing you to easily switch between different Personas depending on your creative needs.

### How to Activate a Persona

1. **Access Muse Extensions**: On the left-hand side of the Muse input box, you’ll see a **circle with three dots**. Tap this to open the **Muse Extensions** menu.
2. **Persona Selection**: In the menu, you’ll find an option labeled **Persona**. If the Persona icon shows a **circle with a slash through it**, this means no Persona is currently active. Tap the icon to view a list of available Personas.
3. **Choosing a Persona**: The **Core Persona** is available to all users, and if you’ve created additional Personas (Pro and Infinite subscribers), they will also be listed here by name. Simply tap the Persona you want to activate, and it will take over for the duration of your conversation.

### Global Persona Settings

It's important to note that Persona selection is **global**, meaning that once you set a Persona, it will remain active across all your conversations until you change it or disable it. This behavior is similar to the way **Muse Mode** and **Model Selection** work.

To switch to a different Persona or disable it entirely, simply return to the **Muse Extensions** menu and either select a new Persona or deactivate the current one by tapping the **Persona** option again.

### Core Persona

The **Core Persona** is a default template available to all users, designed as a general assistant that balances input across storytelling and narrative theory. While it offers a well-rounded experience right out of the box, you can personalize it to better suit your style and preferences.

To customize your Core Persona:

1. **Access Your Account Settings**: Click on the profile icon in the upper right-hand corner of the app to open your Account Settings.
2. **Find the Core Persona**: Look for the section marked "Core" in your Muse Personas settings.
3. **Add Custom Instructions**: Enter any specific instructions you’d like Muse to follow when interacting with you during story development. This could include preferences for tone, focus areas, or unique ways you want Muse to assist in your creative process.

Once you’ve customized your Core Persona, return to Muse:

1. **Open Muse Extensions**: Click the circle with three dots on the left side of the Muse input box.
2. **Select Persona**: Choose the **Core Persona** from the list.

From that point on, your Core Persona will guide future conversations, blending your personalized instructions with Muse’s built-in training for a tailored storytelling experience.

## Creating New Personas

If you’re a Pro or Infinite Subscriber, you have the option to create entirely new Personas tailored to your specific needs. These personalized assistants can be adjusted in several ways, allowing for precise control over how they interact with your stories.

### How to Create a New Persona:

On the Muse Personas page in your Account Settings, tap Add Persona. Subtxt will oblige by adding a new empty Persona that you can customize:

1. **Name**: Give your Persona a unique name that reflects its purpose or role in your storytelling process.
2. **Description**: Define what the Persona is for. For example, is it an idea generator? A character-building specialist? A plot-structuring expert? The description helps clarify its role and helps you stay organized as you switch between different Personas.
3. **Personality**: Here’s where you can have fun! Define the Persona's traits and characteristics. Should it be analytical and critical, or free-spirited and creative? Personality traits help shape how the Persona will respond and engage in conversations with you.
4. **Instructions**: Write specific instructions that will guide the Persona’s interactions. For instance, you might want it to ask probing questions to expand ideas, or offer short, direct feedback to keep you focused.
5. **Focused on Storytelling**: Enable this setting if you want the Persona to concentrate solely on storytelling elements, minimizing any discussions related to narrative theory. This is great for when you're in a flow and don’t want to delve into the mechanics of story structure.

## Customizing Muse Personas for Storytelling

Personas are a way for you to customize your experience with Muse. You can adjust terminology, emojis, etc. Some even go so far as to ask Muse to stop being so nice to them!

Pro/Infinite Subscribers can add multiple Personas, and even set some to Storytelling Only. With this last option, all the story structure "smarts" behind the scenes are removed so you can just focus on the experience of telling a story (the non-subtext aspects).

For instance, here's "Frederick"—a Fountain-format screenwriting expert Persona. His instructions are as follows:

> Please respond in typical Screenplay format. Use the Fountain format (Markdown for screenplays).
>
> Be imaginative, add and expand on the outline presented to you.
> Add detailed descriptions and character interactions to make the scenes more engaging.
> When possible, add dialogue to bring depth to the characters.
> Make sure action lines aren't longer than three sentences.
> No camera movements.
> No parentheticals when writing dialogue please (don't tell the actor how to read the line).
> Start in the middle of the scene (no need for FADE IN).
>
> Make sure to write in active voice (no "is" or "are having," etc.).

With Frederick active, you can easily convert treatments and synopses from Subtxt into screenplay pages using proper formatting, making it a powerful tool for scriptwriting workflows.

## Storytelling Personas in Subtxt

While Subtxt is not specifically designed to generate screenplays or other finished works of fiction, many users leverage it to enhance their creative writing process. This can include everything from screenplay drafts to novel outlines. However, it’s important to understand that Subtxt excels at the narrative structure underneath a story — the deep, foundational framework that supports compelling and meaningful storytelling.

### The Narrative Core vs. Surface-level Storytelling

Subtxt focuses on providing a solid narrative structure, addressing the underlying story mechanics that drive impactful narratives. Many other tools and platforms focus on what could be considered surface-level "superficial" aspects of storytelling — crafting engaging dialogue, writing descriptive prose, or even generating entire scenes.

While these aspects are essential for the art and craft of creative writing, they are not the core focus of Subtxt. The platform is built to help writers uncover the deeper narrative dynamics that elevate their work beyond surface-level storytelling.
