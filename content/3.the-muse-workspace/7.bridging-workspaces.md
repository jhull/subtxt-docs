Subtxt offers two primary ways to engage and receive guidance: the Muse Workspace and the Develop Workspace. While the Muse Workspace is designed for maximizing screen space and facilitating broad exploration, the Develop Workspace provides a deeper dive into key narrative concepts.

In the Develop Workspace, the "pop-up" version of Muse operates similarly to the full Muse Workspace, maintaining seamless context for the Storyform currently being explored. This connection is automatic, so you can transition effortlessly between different perspectives without extra steps.

As we delve further into the Develop Workspace, we'll uncover more ways to harness Museâ€™s capabilities alongside the powerful insights embedded in the Subtxt Narrative Framework.
