3. **Select 'Upload':** Choose the 'Upload' option from the context menu.  
4. **Pick Your File:** Select the document you wish to upload from your device.  
   - **File Size Limit:** Individual uploads are limited to **512MB**.

   > "What seem to be the Four Throughlines of this story?"

You can also just hit the submit button too after uploading and Muse will get to work!

## Uploading Documents into Stories and Storyforms  

In addition to adding documents directly to conversations, documents can be uploaded into two different global contexts: **Stories** and **Storyforms**.  

### Story Context  

- Documents uploaded to a **Story** are available throughout **all conversations** and **Storyforms** connected to that Story.  
- This is an excellent place to store key "worldbuilding" content, such as:  
   - Character backstories  
   - Location descriptions  
   - Synopses or outlines  

Muse and Subtxt will automatically consider this information when answering questions or preparing responses, saving you the need to constantly reintroduce foundational details of your story.  

---

### Storyform Context  

- Documents uploaded to a **Storyform** are only accessible **within that specific Storyform’s context**.  
- Use this option for drafts, scene breakdowns, or specific text you want Muse to analyze within a focused structural framework.  

---

### Upload and Manage Documents  

You can easily upload and manage documents in both contexts:  

1. **Muse Workspace**  
   - While working in a **Story** or **Storyform**, select the **Documents** option from the Workspace.  
   - Upload new documents or manage existing ones (rename or delete as needed).  
   - Muse will generate a convenient **title and summary** of each document upon upload for easy reference, alongside the original filename.  

2. **Develop Workspace**  
   - Documents can also be uploaded and managed in the **Develop Workspace**, located just below **Overviews** in the navigation bar.  

---

### Automatic Document Search  

Once uploaded, Muse will automatically search through these documents when:  
- Answering questions  
- Preparing responses  
- Reviewing story elements  

To make the most of this feature, you can help Muse understand what to focus on by:  
- Referring to documents directly by their **title** or **name** as listed in the **Documents** section.  
- Asking Muse to "look at the document I uploaded" when referencing specific content.  

Muse has an extensive **Narrative Matrix** with a vast store of information, so being specific about which document you’re referencing—especially if they’re uploaded to the **Story** or **Storyform** rather than part of the current conversation—will significantly enhance its ability to provide accurate and targeted insights.  

This allows Muse to provide deeper insights and eliminates the need to repeatedly remind it of key details in your story.

Document search operates on a best-effort basis and may require multiple attempts for Muse to successfully access and reference your uploaded document. This behavior stems from limitations within the third-party API utilized for this feature. You can verify whether a document has been referenced by checking for the **Referenced Uploaded Documents** indicator at the bottom of Muse's response.

## Muse and Storyform Context  

When uploading documents into a **Storyform** context, Muse uses that Storyform's structural framework to analyze your work. This enables more focused and contextualized analysis.  

Examples of how Muse can assist:  

> "Review my uploaded document against the current Storyform and list any inconsistencies."  

> "What areas of the story align with the Main Character Dynamics?"  

> "Do the Objective Story Throughline Storypoints appear as needed in this draft?"  

---

## Privacy and Retention Policy  

Your uploads remain **private and secure**. Subtxt will **NEVER train on your uploaded material**. Uploaded documents are stored temporarily and automatically **expire 7 days after your last interaction**. Once expired, documents are permanently deleted from our system.  

---

## Important Note on Questions  

For the best results, ask Muse specific, targeted questions about your narrative or structure. While Muse can respond to general questions, you’ll receive the most actionable insights by being direct.  

Example prompts:  

> "How does the Relationship Story Throughline Catalyst and Inhibitor work in this draft?"  

> "What does this document reveal about the Influence Character Throughline?"
