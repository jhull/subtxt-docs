### Uploading Step-by-Step

1. **Open Muse:** Begin by opening the Muse Workspace.  
2. **Access the Muse Extension Menu:** Click on the circle with the three dots located to the left of the message box.  
3. **Select 'Upload':** Choose the 'Upload' option from the context menu.  
4. **Pick Your File:** Select the document you wish to upload from your device.  
   - **File Size Limit:** Individual uploads are limited to **512MB**.  
   - **Storage Limits:**  

   | **Subscription Tier**  | **Total Storage** |
   |-------------------------|-------------------|
   | Subtxt                 | 2GB              |
   | Subtxt Pro             | 5GB              |
   | Subtxt Infinite        | 10GB             |

5. **Ask Away:** Once your document is uploaded, feel free to ask Muse anything. For example:  

   > "What seem to be the Four Throughlines of this story?"  

   > "Can you help me build a Storyform for this latest draft?"  

   > "Is this story driven by Actions or by Decisions?"

### Muse and Storyform Context

In the **Muse Workspace**, if your context is set to a Storyform, Subtxt will use that structure to analyze and review your uploaded document. This eliminates the need to continually remind Muse of key structural elements.  

This process allows you to:  
- **Quickly evaluate drafts** using the Storyform already in place.  
- **Upload the latest version of your manuscript** or screenplay.  
- Have Muse automatically review **Storypoints, Storybeats, and Dynamics.**

Example prompts for this functionality:  

> "Review my uploaded document against the current Storyform and list any inconsistencies."  

> "What areas of the story align with the Main Character Dynamics?"  

> "Do the Objective Story Throughline Storypoints appear as needed in this draft?"

### Privacy and Retention Policy

When you upload a document to Subtxt, rest assured that **we NEVER train on any of the material you provide.** We respect your privacy, and training on your uploads would be pointless for our system’s operation.  

Uploaded documents automatically **expire 7 days after your last interaction with them.** Once a document expires, it is permanently deleted from our system.  

This ensures both the protection of your data and that Subtxt remains efficient for your creative process.

### Important Note on Questions

If you ask a broad or generic question like _"What do you think?"_ or _"How am I doing?"_, Muse may respond with a general answer.  

However, more specific questions about narrative structure will yield detailed insights to help refine and define your story.  

Example:  

> "How does the Relationship Story Throughline Catalyst and Inhibitor work in this draft?"

With Muse, feel free to upload story ideas, short scenes, synopses, or complete manuscripts. The narrative analysis you receive back will provide actionable steps to improve and refine your story’s message.
