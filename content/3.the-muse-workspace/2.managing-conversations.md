In addition to the general creative capabilities, Muse offers several tools to help you organize and manage your conversations. These features allow you to customize, save, and revisit your discussions with Muse, making it easier to track your story’s development.

## The Conversation

Interacting with Muse is like diving into a stream-of-consciousness brainstorming session. The flow of ideas is organic and free-form, allowing you to explore various creative avenues without feeling restricted. Each conversation with Muse feels like an ongoing dialogue, evolving as new insights and directions emerge.

### Favoriting
You can highlight key moments in your conversation by marking them as favorites. This allows you to quickly return to important ideas, breakthroughs, or insights without needing to scroll through the entire conversation. It’s a handy way to keep track of critical points in your creative process.

### Change the Name of the Conversation
Organize your conversations by renaming them based on the story thread, theme, or brainstorming session. This feature helps you manage multiple projects or ideas and ensures that each conversation has a clear, relevant label for easy access.

### Download Conversations
You can download any conversation with Muse at any time (file downloaded into the Markdown format). This feature allows you to save a complete transcript of your discussions, giving you a permanent record of all your creative exchanges. You can review these later for further development or inspiration.

### Delete Conversations
If a conversation is no longer relevant or you want to keep your workspace tidy, you can delete it. This feature helps you declutter your workspace and keep your focus on the most productive and useful discussions.

## Moving Conversations

You can easily move a conversation from one Storyform into another, or even into a different story, simply by asking Muse.

> Can you move this conversation into the main story this Storyform belongs to?

## Importing Conversations

While you don’t need to worry about how long a conversation with Muse gets, if you ever want to use the information from one conversation in another, it’s a simple process. Just download the conversation as a file, create a new conversation, and upload that file into the new one. Muse will then have access to the previous conversation within the context of the current session, allowing you to seamlessly continue your work from where you left off.
