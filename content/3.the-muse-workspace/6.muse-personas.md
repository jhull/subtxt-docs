Muse Personas allow you to create personalized AI assistants that can guide and support different aspects of your story development. Whether you want a more structured approach to narrative theory or a creative companion focused solely on storytelling, Muse Personas provide a flexible toolset to match your workflow.

## What are Muse Personas?

Muse Personas are customizable AI helpers designed to enhance your storytelling process. Each Persona can be fine-tuned to assist you in different phases of your story's development, from brainstorming new ideas to refining complex narrative structures. With their unique personalities and specialized instructions, Personas can help keep your creative journey engaging and focused.

With the ability to create multiple Personas, you can switch between them depending on your current creative focus. Whether you're working on high-level world-building or refining a specific character, your Personas can be there to assist in any phase of story development.

## Activating and Managing Muse Personas

To use Muse Personas, you'll access them through the **Muse Extensions** menu, allowing you to easily switch between different Personas depending on your creative needs.

### How to Activate a Persona

1. **Access Muse Extensions**: On the left-hand side of the Muse input box, you’ll see a **circle with three dots**. Tap this to open the **Muse Extensions** menu.

2. **Persona Selection**: In the menu, you’ll find an option labeled **Persona**. If the Persona icon shows a **circle with a slash through it**, this means no Persona is currently active. Tap the icon to view a list of available Personas.

3. **Choosing a Persona**: The **Core Persona** is available to all users, and if you’ve created additional Personas (Pro and Infinite subscribers), they will also be listed here by name. Simply tap the Persona you want to activate, and it will take over for the duration of your conversation.

### Global Persona Settings

It's important to note that Persona selection is **global**, meaning that once you set a Persona, it will remain active across all your conversations until you change it or disable it. This behavior is similar to the way **Muse Mode** and **Model Selection** work.

To switch to a different Persona or disable it entirely, simply return to the **Muse Extensions** menu and either select a new Persona or deactivate the current one by tapping the **Persona** option again.

### Core Persona

The **Core Persona** is a default template available to all users, designed as a general assistant that balances input across storytelling and narrative theory. While it offers a well-rounded experience right out of the box, you can personalize it to better suit your style and preferences.

To customize your Core Persona:

1. **Access Your Account Settings**: Click on the profile icon in the upper right-hand corner of the app to open your Account Settings.
2. **Find the Core Persona**: Look for the section marked "Core" in your Muse Personas settings.
3. **Add Custom Instructions**: Enter any specific instructions you’d like Muse to follow when interacting with you during story development. This could include preferences for tone, focus areas, or unique ways you want Muse to assist in your creative process.

Once you’ve customized your Core Persona, return to Muse:

1. **Open Muse Extensions**: Click the circle with three dots on the left side of the Muse input box.
2. **Select Persona**: Choose the **Core Persona** from the list.

From that point on, your Core Persona will guide future conversations, blending your personalized instructions with Muse’s built-in training for a tailored storytelling experience.

## Creating New Personas

If you’re a Pro or Infinite Subscriber, you have the option to create entirely new Personas tailored to your specific needs. These personalized assistants can be adjusted in several ways, allowing for precise control over how they interact with your stories.

### How to Create a New Persona:

On the Muse Personas page in your Account Settings, tap Add Persona. Subtxt will oblige by adding a new empty Persona that you can customize:

1. **Name**: Give your Persona a unique name that reflects its purpose or role in your storytelling process.

2. **Description**: Define what the Persona is for. For example, is it an idea generator? A character-building specialist? A plot-structuring expert? The description helps clarify its role and helps you stay organized as you switch between different Personas.

3. **Personality**: Here’s where you can have fun! Define the Persona's traits and characteristics. Should it be analytical and critical, or free-spirited and creative? Personality traits help shape how the Persona will respond and engage in conversations with you.

4. **Instructions**: Write specific instructions that will guide the Persona’s interactions. For instance, you might want it to ask probing questions to expand ideas, or offer short, direct feedback to keep you focused.

5. **Focused on Storytelling**: Enable this setting if you want the Persona to concentrate solely on storytelling elements, minimizing any discussions related to narrative theory. This is great for when you're in a flow and don’t want to delve into the mechanics of story structure.

## Use Cases for Muse Personas

Muse Personas can be customized to suit a variety of storytelling needs:

- **Character Development Persona**: Create a Persona focused solely on helping you develop characters. You can program it to ask about character motivations, backstories, and emotional arcs, guiding you toward well-rounded, complex characters.

- **Plot Specialist Persona**: This Persona can help you refine plot points, suggest twists, and evaluate story pacing. Customize its instructions to ask critical questions about story beats and tension-building techniques.

- **Brainstorming Persona**: Want a creative partner to bounce ideas off of? A brainstorming Persona can provide wild, out-of-the-box suggestions or help you refine abstract concepts into workable story ideas.

- **Narrative Theory Persona**: For users more focused on the theoretical side of storytelling, this Persona could provide deep insights into structural elements like thematic argument, narrative conflict, and overall coherence within the Storyform.
