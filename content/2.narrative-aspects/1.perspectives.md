## Introduction

**Perspectives** in Subtxt enable you to explore different viewpoints within your story’s structure, adding depth and complexity to the narrative. By assigning Storypoints and Storybeats to various Perspectives, you can see how different characters or thematic arguments address the same central conflict, making it easier to track how each viewpoint contributes to the overall Throughline.

## Understanding Perspectives and Throughlines

Perspectives in Subtxt operate within the framework of the four primary **Throughlines**, which represent the different vantage points that encompass a story’s thematic conflict:

1. **Objective Story**: The "big picture" view of the story, focusing on the overall conflict that affects all characters.
2. **Main Character**: The story as experienced through the personal journey of the protagonist.
3. **Obstacle Character**: The perspective of a character who challenges the Main Character’s beliefs and actions.
4. **Relationship Story**: The emotional and thematic conflict between the Main Character and the Obstacle Character.

These Throughlines provide a structure for analyzing how different characters interact with the story’s central themes and conflicts. By utilizing **Perspectives**, you can present these Throughlines not as isolated elements, but as interconnected views that shift from one character or thematic argument to the next, creating a more cohesive and dynamic story experience.

## Creating Multiple Perspectives within a Throughline

The Perspectives feature allows you to break down a single Throughline into several different viewpoints, making it easier to see how various characters address or expose the same thematic conflict. This process is called a **handoff**: one character’s perspective on the Throughline hands off to another, maintaining the same thematic argument but enriching it with a fresh angle.

### Example: The Lego Batman Movie

In *The Lego Batman Movie*, the story revolves around Batman’s struggle with relationships and teamwork. The thematic issue of "needing to work together" is explored through the perspectives of several characters in the **Obstacle Character Throughline**:

1. **Alfred** starts by emphasizing the importance of family and teamwork, pointing out Batman’s resistance to it.
2. **Robin** continues this argument by showing excitement about joining Batman, representing the potential joy and fulfillment that can come from partnership.
3. **Barbara Gordon** picks up the argument by pushing Batman to work within the law and consider collaboration with Gotham PD.
4. **The Joker** then drives home the same thematic conflict by challenging Batman’s refusal to acknowledge the need for relationships, even with his adversaries.

Each of these characters hands off the thematic conflict to the next, providing a cohesive yet multifaceted exploration of the same Throughline: Batman’s need to accept help and work with others.

## How to Use Perspectives in Subtxt

The **Perspectives** feature helps you organize and assign **Storypoints**, **Storybeats**, and **Overviews** to specific viewpoints within a Throughline. This ensures your story’s thematic exploration remains clear while tracking its detailed structure.

### Filtering Perspectives

The Perspectives tool allows you to filter Narrative Aspects to focus on specific elements of your story:  

- **All**: Displays every Narrative Aspect, regardless of whether it’s assigned to a Perspective.  
- **Assigned**: Shows only Narrative Aspects linked to a Perspective, helping you track progress within a Throughline.  
- **Unassigned**: Lists Narrative Aspects without a Perspective, making it easy to identify what still needs to be integrated into your story.

This filtering system provides clarity and control, ensuring every part of your story is accounted for and developed.

### Assigning Narrative Aspects to Perspectives

Assigning Perspectives helps you connect Narrative Aspects—such as Storypoints, Storybeats, or Overviews—to the correct Throughline:

1. **Access the Perspectives Tool**:  
   Click the **Perspectives button** (dashed circle icon) available in the Subtxt interface.

2. **Assigning a Narrative Aspect**:  
   - Open any unassigned Narrative Aspect.  
   - Select the appropriate Perspective from the dropdown menu to link it to a Throughline.  

3. **Creating Storypoints or Storybeats for a Perspective**:  
   - If a selected Perspective has no Storypoints or Storybeats yet, click the **Illustrate** button to generate and attach new ones automatically.  

This process ensures your story is systematically structured, with each Perspective properly represented.

### Why Use Perspectives?

The **Perspectives** feature in Subtxt enables you to craft multi-layered narratives by filtering and assigning elements efficiently. By focusing on specific viewpoints or organizing diverse thematic aspects, you can create a story that is both cohesive and richly detailed.
