description: Understanding and developing the roles of Players within your story
---

In Subtxt, we use the term **Players** instead of "characters" to emphasize their specific roles within the **Objective Story Throughline**. Unlike traditional character roles, Players can adapt to different functions in a story; for example, a Main Character might serve as the Protagonist in one story but as the Antagonist in another. This flexible approach supports a more nuanced and versatile narrative structure.

## Where to Find Players in Subtxt

You’ll find the list of **Players** in the **Plot & Players** section of **Forming** in the **Develop Workspace**, or above a **Storyform** in the **Muse Workspace**. Here, you can add and delete Players or even generate a full cast of **Archetypal Players** based on your Story Idea or the Objective Story Throughline.

## Initial Setup and Key Players

When you first access the **Players** section, you will typically see two Players already created: one marked **Main Character** and one marked **Obstacle Character**. These Players highlight the critical concept that those who fulfill roles in their subjective Throughlines (the **Main Character Throughline** and **Obstacle Character Throughline**) also play vital parts in the **Objective Story Throughline**. These pivotal elements embody the narrative’s central argument and represent two opposing yet interconnected perspectives.

### Pivotal Elements: Unchangeable Roles

The Main Character and Obstacle Character are marked in red to indicate that they are essential and cannot be removed without disrupting the narrative's integrity. While you can add more Motivations to these Players, their core roles must remain intact.

## Developing and Surfacing Players

Working with **Players** in Subtxt follows the familiar pattern of starting with in-depth development. Begin by assigning **Motivations** to each Player, which are crucial for defining their function relative to the **Story Goal**. Once these are set, surface them into **Storytelling**, which moves beyond mere description to illustrate their role in relation to the plot. If you have already defined the **Story Goal** in the **Plot** section or within the **Objective Story Throughline** of the **Illustrating** section, Subtxt will automatically integrate these motivations into context when you use the **BrainstormingAI** tool located between the Motivations and Storytelling panels.

### Adding and Customizing Motivations

To add new **Motivations** to a Player, click **Add** and select from one of the 64 available motivations. You can also tap the **Select** button to have Subtxt suggest unassigned motivations. While it’s possible to assign the same Motivation to different Players, creating unique Motivations helps maintain diversity in their interactions. If multiple Players share the same Motivation (e.g., **Faith**), they may become redundant in scenes, limiting narrative complexity.

### Illustrating and Removing Motivations

Once a Motivation is assigned, you can write down how it manifests in the story or use the **Random Illustration** button for inspiration. Motivations can be removed at any time by clicking on the Motivation and confirming the action.

## Generating Character Relationships

After developing and assigning Players to the **Objective Story Throughline Perspective**, you can create a **Character Relationship Overview** by surfacing all Players. This overview, found at the top of the Players screen, provides a comprehensive map of how Players relate to each other. By surfacing Motivations into Players and then Players into relationships, Subtxt and Muse can use these dynamics to suggest relevant **Storypoints** and **Storybeats** as you shape your narrative.

Working with **Players** ensures that your story’s structure is robust and that each role is meaningful, supporting a dynamic and engaging narrative.
