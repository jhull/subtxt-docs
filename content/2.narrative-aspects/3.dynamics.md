description: Understanding the forces that drive narrative change in Subtxt
---

**Dynamics** in Subtxt are the forces that drive and shape your narrative, influencing the story’s direction and character development. By understanding and applying these pressures, you can strengthen your story’s core argument and add depth to its emotional and thematic impact.

## Key Dynamics in Subtxt

The Dynamics of a story can be divided into several key categories: **Resolve Dynamics**, **Character Dynamics**, **Storyform Dynamics**, and **Plot Dynamics**. Each category highlights different aspects of how a story evolves and communicates its core meaning.

---

### Resolve Dynamics

Resolve Dynamics focus on the core philosophical stances of the Main and Obstacle Characters, forming an inverse relationship that underscores the story's thematic argument:

1. **Main Character Resolve**: This Dynamic determines whether the Main Character ultimately changes their beliefs or holds firm. A **Change** resolve signals personal transformation, while a **Steadfast** resolve often highlights the enduring nature of their core values.

2. **Obstacle Character Resolve**: The Obstacle Character’s Resolve is always the inverse of the Main Character’s Resolve. If the Main Character **Changes**, the Obstacle Character remains **Steadfast**, and vice versa. This relationship creates dramatic tension and reinforces the thematic dichotomy at the heart of the story.

### Character Dynamics

Character Dynamics explore the internal and external methods by which the Main Character interacts with challenges, illuminating their personal growth and approach:

1. **Main Character Growth**: This Dynamic describes the direction of the Main Character's internal change, focusing on whether they are moving toward **Stop** or **Start**:

- **Stop**: The Main Character sheds negative traits or destructive behaviors, eliminating obstacles to growth and resolution (e.g., moving from denial to acceptance or from fear to courage).
- **Start**: The Main Character acquires new strengths, developing positive qualities to overcome challenges and achieve their goals.

Growth establishes the trajectory of the protagonist’s transformation, shaping the emotional arc of the narrative. 

2. **Main Character Approach**: This Dynamic refers to how the Main Character confronts problems:
   - **Do-er**: Addresses conflicts through external actions.
   - **Be-er**: Adapts internally to manage challenges.

### Storyform Dynamics

Storyform Dynamics define the broader, universal forces that establish the structural and thematic integrity of the narrative:

1. **Storyform Alignment**: This Dynamic explores the narrative’s underlying alignment, distinguishing between **Dopamine-aligned** (focused on rewards, goals, and achievement) and **Serotonin-aligned** (centered on relationships, intentions, and emotional harmony). These alignments shape the story's thematic core and the audience's emotional connection.

2. **Narrative Field**: This Dynamic examines the interplay between **Spacetime** and **Timespace**, representing the objective and subjective relationships regarding Space and Time within the narrative. In **Spacetime**, space is objective while time is subjective, and in **Timespace**, time is objective while space is subjective. This framework captures the dynamic, emergent nature of storytelling, enriching its complexity and depth.

### Plot Dynamics

Plot Dynamics guide the progression of events and outcomes in the story, shaping the audience's experience and emotional journey:

1. **Story Driver**: The type of events that propel the story forward:
   - **Action**: External events lead to decisions.
   - **Decision**: Choices lead to subsequent actions.

2. **Story Outcome**: The result of the story’s central conflict:
   - **Success**: The overarching problem is resolved.
   - **Failure**: Efforts to resolve the problem fall short.

3. **Story Judgment**: The emotional evaluation of the story’s outcome from the Main Character’s perspective:
   - **Good**: The Main Character feels content and fulfilled.
   - **Bad**: The Main Character is left dissatisfied or defeated.

## How to Use Dynamics in Subtxt

In Subtxt, analyzing and adjusting Dynamics helps clarify the central argument of your story and ensures that the narrative develops logically. When setting up Dynamics:

- **Select Dynamics During Story Creation**: Choose these elements when defining the initial parameters of your story. This choice impacts how Throughlines interact and evolve.
- **Adjust as Needed**: Revisit your Dynamics as the story takes shape to ensure they align with new developments or thematic insights.

By incorporating Dynamics thoughtfully, you provide your story with a compelling structure that showcases not just what happens, but why it matters and how it impacts the characters and their world.

## How to Use Dynamics in Subtxt

You can find **Dynamics** in Subtxt under the **Storyform** section of **Forming** in the **Develop Workspace**, as well as listed above **Storyforms** in the **Muse Workspace**. Whether chosen by you when shaping your narrative into a Storyform or set automatically behind the scenes, these elements can be accessed individually. You can also add or adjust them within an existing Storyform to delve deeper into your story’s thematic and structural nuances.

Using Dynamics effectively clarifies the central argument of your story, ensuring that the narrative unfolds in a meaningful and coherent way.
