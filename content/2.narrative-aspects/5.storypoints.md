title: Storypoints
description: "Key thematic elements that shape your narrative's meaning"
---

**Storypoints** in Subtxt represent the core ideas and themes that run throughout your story, providing a way to express its deeper meaning and thematic essence. Organized by **Throughline**, Storypoints help authors pinpoint and articulate the unique aspects of conflict from various perspectives, reinforcing how and why the story unfolds.  

At their core, Storypoints are a way to **identify the source of conflict** in a given perspective. To fully explore a narrative's meaning, Subtxt introduces a structured method of discovery:  

## **The Four Fs of Finding a Source of Conflict**  

Every conflict in a story operates within a **Perspective** (I, You, We, They). From this vantage point, we uncover the nature of its inequity by moving through four distinct layers of understanding:  

1. **Form** – What is the general nature of the conflict? (External, Internal, Framing, Processing)  
2. **Field** – How does the conflict manifest within its environment? (Foundational, Expansive, Functional, Deliberative)  
3. **Facet** – What specific characteristic of this conflict is in focus? (Skill, Experience, Perspective, Influence, etc.)  
4. **Force** – What tensions sustain the inequity? (Problem/Solution/Focus/Direction or Condition/Adjustment/Resistance/Flow)  

This structured approach ensures that every Storypoint not only categorizes conflict but also reveals **why the imbalance persists** within the story's framework.

## **Understanding Storypoints by Throughline**  

Each **Throughline**—Objective Story, Main Character, Obstacle Character, and Relationship Story—has its own set of Storypoints, which reflect a unique **Perspective** on the central conflict. While all Throughlines may share thematic similarities, their expressions and interactions differ according to their **Form, Field, Facet, and Force** and the **Dynamics** that influence them.  

### **The Essential Four**  

For each Throughline, there are four primary Storypoints essential to developing your narrative:  

1. **Form** – Establishes the **nature** of the conflict, shaping how it is perceived and experienced.  
2. **Field** – Defines **where** the conflict takes place and how it interacts with its environment.  
3. **Facet** – Identifies **which specific aspect** of the conflict is in focus, adding depth and nuance.  
4. **Force** – Reveals the **tensions that sustain** the conflict, driving its persistence and evolution.  

These four layers work together to ensure a **clear, structured understanding of conflict** while allowing for flexibility and discovery within a story’s development.

## **Additional Storypoints for Depth**  

Beyond the essential four, each Throughline can include additional Storypoints to further **clarify the forces at play** in the narrative:  

- **Focus, Direction, Solution, and Benchmark** – These Storypoints refine the **specific areas of inequity and movement** within the conflict.  
- **Unique Abilities & Critical Flaws** – (specific to the Main Character and Obstacle Character Throughlines) – Highlighting key personal strengths and weaknesses.  
- **Catalysts & Inhibitors** – (specific to the Objective Story and Relationship Story Throughlines) – Influencing the pacing and escalation of conflict.

## **Special Relationship Story Appreciations**  

The **Relationship Story Throughline** differs from the standard structure, emphasizing movement and balance over direct problem-solving.  

- Instead of **Problem**, we use **Condition**, and instead of **Solution**, we use **Adjustment**—focusing on the conditions and shifts that shape the relationship.  
- Instead of **Focus and Direction**, we use **Resistance and Flow**, emphasizing how relationships develop and evolve over time.  

These modifications highlight that the **Relationship Story** functions differently than other Throughlines—it is not about **solving** conflict but rather **understanding the shifting dynamics** between characters.

## **The Influence of Serotonin on Narrative**  

When the **Narrative Alignment** is set to **Serotonin**, all Throughlines adopt the **Condition/Adjustment/Resistance/Flow** framework. This reflects a **non-linear approach to conflict**, where tension is experienced as an ongoing process rather than a fixed problem to be solved.  

---

## **Objective Story Static Story Points**  

The **Objective Story Throughline** includes additional Storypoints that provide a **structural foundation for the plot**:  

- **Story Goal** – The desired resolution to the primary conflict.  
- **Story Consequence** – What happens if the Story Goal is not achieved.  

In **Serotonin-aligned** stories, these points are reframed:  
- The **Condition for conflict** becomes **Story Intention**, representing the underlying purpose or aim.  
- Its balance shifts into **Story Overwhelm**, capturing the weight of ongoing uncertainty.  

These shifts help convey the unique challenges and **perspectives on conflict** in different types of narratives.  

---

## **Additional Objective Story Storypoints**  

While not essential, developing these additional Storypoints can **enhance thematic depth**:  

- **Story Requirements** – What must be done to achieve the Goal.  
- **Story Prerequisites, Preconditions, and Dividends** – The stepping stones toward success and their benefits.  
- **Story Costs and Forewarnings** – The sacrifices made and the looming signs of failure.  

These **structural elements** refine how your story unfolds, making sure every piece contributes to the **larger narrative argument**.

## **Working with Storypoints in Subtxt**  

Storypoints are organized by Throughline and can be found within the **Forming** section in the **Develop Workspace** or above a **Storyform** in the **Muse Workspace**.  

After developing the essential Storypoints, Subtxt allows you to surface them into a **Storypoint Overview**, which visually summarizes the core ideas of each Throughline. This structured approach ensures that your story’s **narrative argument remains clear, intentional, and thematically rich**.

### **The Four Fs in Action**  

The **Four Fs**—Form, Field, Facet, and Force—allow us to view Storypoints not just as **labels**, but as an **active way of understanding conflict**. Instead of reducing a story to static categories, this method ensures that each **Throughline is shaped by the forces that sustain its inequity**.  

By structuring **Form → Field → Facet → Force**, every Storypoint becomes a **window into the deeper meaning of conflict**—not just what it is, but how it persists, how it influences the story, and ultimately, why it matters.
