description: Key thematic elements that shape your narrative's meaning
---

**Storypoints** in Subtxt represent the core ideas and themes that run throughout your story, providing a way to express its deeper meaning and thematic essence. Organized by **Throughline**, Storypoints help authors pinpoint and articulate the unique aspects of conflict from various perspectives, reinforcing how and why the story unfolds.

## Understanding Storypoints by Throughline

Each **Throughline**—Objective Story, Main Character, Obstacle Character, and Relationship Story—has its own set of Storypoints, which reflect a unique view on the central conflict. While all Throughlines may share thematic similarities, their expressions and interactions differ according to their narrative roles and the **Dynamics** that influence them.

### The Essential Four Storypoints

For each Throughline, there are four primary Storypoints essential to developing your narrative:

1. **Domain**: The overarching context of the Throughline’s conflict.
2. **Concern**: The primary area of focus or interest within the Domain.
3. **Issue**: A thematic problem that provides depth and nuance to the story’s main conflict.
4. **Problem**: The source of conflict driving the Throughline.

Completing these four Storypoints offers a strong foundation for your narrative. Once established, you can surface these into a **Storypoint Overview**, which provides a high-level summary of each Throughline’s thematic essence.

### Additional Storypoints for Depth

To add further detail, each Throughline can include additional Storypoints:

- **Focus**, **Direction**, **Solution**, and **Benchmark**: These Storypoints provide deeper insight into how the conflict develops and resolves.
- **Unique Abilities** and **Critical Flaws** (specific to the Main Character and Obstacle Character Throughlines) tie these personal arcs to the broader Objective Story.
- **Catalysts** and **Inhibitors** (specific to the Objective Story and Relationship Story Throughlines) affect the pacing and progression of conflict.

## Special Relationship Story Appreciations

The **Relationship Story Throughline** has unique Storypoints that differ from the standard structure:

- Instead of **Problem**, you have **Condition**, and instead of **Solution**, you have **Adjustment**. This reflects the relational focus on growth and movement rather than direct problem-solving.
- **Resistance** and **Flow** replace **Focus** and **Direction**, emphasizing the balance and dynamics of the relationship’s evolution.

These modifications highlight that the Relationship Story is less about problem-solving and more about the conditions and adjustments that bring characters together or pull them apart.

### The Influence of Serotonin on Narrative

In narratives where the **Narrative Alignment** is set to **Serotonin**, all Throughlines adopt the Condition/Adjustment/Resistance/Flow framework. This approach better represents the non-linear growth and thematic exploration typical of such stories.

## Objective Story Static Story Points

The **Objective Story Throughline** features additional **Objecctive Story Storypoints** that contribute to a richer understanding of your story's plot:

- **Story Goal**: The outcome the characters strive for to resolve the main conflict.
- **Story Consequence**: What happens if the Story Goal is not achieved, with the initial Problem taking precedence over the Solution.

In **Serotnin-aligned** stories, these points are reframed: the **Condition for conflict** is represented as **Story Intention**, and its balance becomes **Story Overwhelm**. These changes help convey the unique challenges and outcomes present in such narratives.

### Additional Objective Story Storypoints

While not essential for a strong Objective Story Throughline, developing these additional Static Story Points can enrich your story:

- **Story Requirements**: What must be accomplished to achieve the Goal.
- **Story Prerequisites**, **Preconditions**, and **Dividends**: Conditions and rewards tied to progressing toward the Goal.
- **Story Costs** and **Forewarnings**: The sacrifices required and signs of impending failure.

These Storypoints offer tools to refine your story’s plot and deepen its thematic impact.

## Working with Storypoints in Subtxt

Storypoints are organized by Throughline and can be found within the **Forming** section in the **Develop Workspace** or above a **Storyform** in the **Muse Workspace**. After developing the essential Storypoints, Subtxt allows you to surface them into a **Storypoint Overview** that visually summarizes each Throughline’s core ideas. This structured approach helps ensure your story’s narrative argument is consistent and compelling.
