description: Understanding the broader elements of your narrative in Subtxt
---

**Overviews** in Subtxt are high-level storytelling elements that outline your story’s direction and themes, including Throughline descriptions, plot summaries, and character arcs. These provide a clear framework that helps align detailed narrative elements with the overarching vision of your story.

## The Role of Overviews in Subtxt

Subtxt's approach emphasizes understanding the core meaning of your story before refining its surface presentation. Overviews act as an essential bridge between deep thematic exploration and the more tangible, audience-facing storytelling aspects. By starting with Overviews, writers create a solid thematic foundation that supports subsequent narrative developments. This method allows writers to establish clarity about their narrative's objectives before building out intricate Storypoints, Storybeats, or specific scenes.

### Importance of Starting with Meaning

In Subtxt, the goal is to work from the **inside out**. This means exploring the subtext and thematic underpinnings first and then letting that work shape the "surface" or visible storytelling. The **Surface Storytelling button** (represented by a circled up arrow) is central to this process. Found throughout Subtxt, from Throughlines to Character Arcs and Storypoints to Storybeats, this feature enables you to "surface" the insights developed in the Overview phase, transforming them into elements that can be directly woven into your narrative.

## How Overviews Integrate with Other Narrative Aspects

Overviews not only define the story’s big-picture direction but also interact dynamically with other aspects of storytelling in Subtxt:

1. **Four Throughlines**: Each story includes four main Throughlines — Objective Story, Main Character, Obstacle Character, and Relationship Story. A Blended Overview of all these Throughlines helps encapsulate their unique contributions to the story's central thematic conflict.
   
2. **Character Arcs**: Overviews outline the arcs of key characters, showing how they evolve in response to internal and external challenges. This initial mapping helps identify how each character's journey ties into the larger narrative.

3. **Plot Synopses**: Summaries of major plot movements serve as a guide for pacing and structure. They ensure the story maintains a coherent flow that reflects the intended emotional and thematic journey.

By initially focusing on these Overviews, writers create a blueprint that anchors the story and makes subsequent detailing—like assigning Storypoints or crafting Storybeats—more intuitive and aligned with the overarching narrative goals.

## Types of Overviews

Subtxt offers a variety of Overview types, each designed to help writers focus on different facets of their narrative. These Overviews can be found across multiple sections of the app, ensuring a consistent and cohesive storytelling experience.

1. **Logline**  
   A concise summary that captures the core of the story, including its central conflict, characters, and stakes. The logline serves as a foundational touchstone, helping writers stay focused on their story's thematic and emotional essence.

2. **Genre Dynamics**  
   This Overview outlines the narrative’s overall essence, including its tone, mood, visual aesthetics, and thematic rhythms. This is especially useful for guiding generative AI features in Subtxt, such as audio or visual creation, ensuring these outputs align with the desired atmosphere of the story.

3. **Synopses Across Story Sections**  
   Synopses are detailed Overviews that summarize key elements of the narrative, allowing writers to capture the story's flow and thematic essence at various levels. These include:  
   
   - **Four Throughlines**: Each Throughline—Objective Story, Main Character, Obstacle Character, and Relationship Story—includes its own synopsis to encapsulate the unique contribution of each perspective to the story's central thematic conflict.  
   - **Plot Synopsis**: A high-level summary of the story's major plot movements, ensuring clarity and coherence across the narrative's pacing and structure.  
   - **Character Relationships (Players)**: Synopses in this section highlight the dynamics between characters, focusing on how their relationships evolve and intersect with the overarching narrative.  
   - **Character Arcs**: These synopses summarize the growth and transformation of key characters, connecting their personal journeys to the larger thematic framework.  

4. **Storypoint Synopses**  
   Found within each Throughline, Storypoint Synopses provide a focused Overview of individual narrative beats. These help clarify the purpose and thematic weight of specific plot points, ensuring they align with the overall story structure.

## Flexibility and Reiteration

One of Subtxt’s powerful features is the ability to revisit and refine Overviews. Writers can edit existing Overviews to match new thematic insights or adjust story directions. This iterative process is supported by the **Surface Storytelling** tool, which allows updates to be surfaced seamlessly. If changes occur at the foundational level of the story (e.g., within the subtext), the impact can be visualized and updated in the Overview, ensuring consistency across the entire narrative.

## Crafting Effective Overviews

### Steps to Create an Overview in Subtxt

Creating Overviews in Subtxt is simple and intuitive, with multiple ways to approach the process. 

1. **From the Overviews Tab in the Develop Workspace**  
   Navigate to the **Overviews** tab within the Develop Workspace. Here, you can manually create and edit Overviews, specifying the type (e.g., Logline, Genre Dynamics) and filling in the details to shape the high-level elements of your story.

2. **Using Muse in the Muse Workspace**  
   You can also ask Muse to create Overviews for you directly. For example, type a request such as:  
   _"Create a Genre Dynamics Overview for this story."_  
   Muse will generate the Overview automatically, leveraging its understanding of your story's subtext and structure. This feature is a quick and effective way to kickstart or refine your narrative.

3. **Assigning Perspectives to Overviews**  
   After creating an Overview, you can assign it a **Perspective** to better integrate it into the rest of your story. This step is particularly useful for aligning Overviews with Storypoint and Storybeat generation across the app. By doing so, the thematic and structural insights captured in the Overview can dynamically inform other narrative elements, ensuring a consistent and cohesive storytelling experience.

### Using Subtxt Tools to Enhance Overviews

- **Surface Storytelling**: Once the Narrative Aspects below the surface are created, use the **Surface Storytelling button** to generate an Overview based on the thematic groundwork. This feature ensures a fluid transition from thematic insight to plot and scene construction.
- **Editing and Refining**: Overviews can be updated at any stage. Adjust the underlying subtext, and then re-surface the Overview to reflect new ideas seamlessly.

## Summary

Overviews in Subtxt provide writers with a comprehensive vision of their story. By focusing on these high-level elements before delving into scene-level details, authors can ensure that every part of their narrative stays true to its thematic roots. This foundational approach, supported by tools like **Surface Storytelling**, makes Subtxt a powerful platform for crafting stories that resonate deeply and maintain coherence from start to finish.
