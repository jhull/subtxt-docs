description: Understanding the broader elements of your narrative in Subtxt

**Overviews** in Subtxt are high-level storytelling elements that outline your story’s direction and themes, including Throughline descriptions, plot summaries, and character arcs. These provide a clear framework that helps align detailed narrative elements with the overarching vision of your story.

## The Role of Overviews in Subtxt

Subtxt's approach emphasizes understanding the core meaning of your story before refining its surface presentation. Overviews act as an essential bridge between deep thematic exploration and the more tangible, audience-facing storytelling aspects. By starting with Overviews, writers create a solid thematic foundation that supports subsequent narrative developments. This method allows writers to establish clarity about their narrative's objectives before building out intricate Storypoints, Storybeats, or specific scenes.

### Importance of Starting with Meaning

In Subtxt, the goal is to work from the **inside out**. This means exploring the subtext and thematic underpinnings first and then letting that work shape the "surface" or visible storytelling. The **Surface Storytelling button** (represented by a circled up arrow) is central to this process. Found throughout Subtxt, from Throughlines to Character Arcs and Storypoints to Storybeats, this feature enables you to "surface" the insights developed in the Overview phase, transforming them into elements that can be directly woven into your narrative.

## How Overviews Integrate with Other Narrative Aspects

Overviews not only define the story’s big-picture direction but also interact dynamically with other aspects of storytelling in Subtxt:

1. **Four Throughlines**: Each story includes four main Throughlines — Objective Story, Main Character, Obstacle Character, and Relationship Story. A Blended Overview of all these Throughlines help encapsulate their unique contributions to the story's central thematic conflict.
   
2. **Character Arcs**: Overviews outline the arcs of key characters, showing how they evolve in response to internal and external challenges. This initial mapping helps identify how each character's journey ties into the larger narrative.

3. **Plot Synopses**: Summaries of major plot movements serve as a guide for pacing and structure. They ensure the story maintains a coherent flow that reflects the intended emotional and thematic journey.

By initially focusing on these Overviews, writers create a blueprint that anchors the story and makes subsequent detailing—like assigning Storypoints or crafting Storybeats—more intuitive and aligned with the overarching narrative goals.

### Flexibility and Reiteration

One of Subtxt’s powerful features is the ability to revisit and refine Overviews. Writers can edit existing Overviews to match new thematic insights or adjust story directions. This iterative process is supported by the **Surface Storytelling** tool, which allows updates to be surfaced seamlessly. If changes occur at the foundational level of the story (e.g., within the subtext), the impact can be visualized and updated in the Overview, ensuring consistency across the entire narrative.

## Crafting Effective Overviews

### Steps to Create an Overview in Subtxt

1. **Focus on Individual Aspects**: Begin by concentrating on each narrative Aspect one at a time. Dive deeply into developing each component until fully explored and articulated.
   
2. **Move to the Next Aspect**: Once you have thoroughly fleshed out one Aspect, proceed to the next, ensuring each is detailed before integrating them into a cohesive Overview.

### Using Subtxt Tools to Enhance Overviews

- **Surface Storytelling**: Once the Narrative Aspects below the surface are created, use the **Surface Storytelling button** to generate an Overview based on the thematic groundwork. This feature ensures a fluid transition from thematic insight to plot and scene construction.
- **Editing and Refining**: Overviews can be updated at any stage. Adjust the underlying subtext, and then re-surface the Overview to reflect new ideas seamlessly.

## Summary

Overviews in Subtxt provide writers with a comprehensive vision of their story. By focusing on these high-level elements before delving into scene-level details, authors can ensure that every part of their narrative stays true to its thematic roots. This foundational approach, supported by tools like **Surface Storytelling**, makes Subtxt a powerful platform for crafting stories that resonate deeply and maintain coherence from start to finish.
