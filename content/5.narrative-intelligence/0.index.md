Subtxtâ€™s approach to **Narrative Intelligence** sets it apart from traditional storytelling tools. By combining the analytical depth of AI with a rich narrative framework, Subtxt helps writers move beyond basic guidance and into meaningful story development. This fusion allows the platform to not only support but actively engage with writers in crafting complex, layered narratives.

## Constant Improvement

As smart as LLMs and state-of-the-art AI tech is today, it can be even smarter--and that's where you come in.

Throughout Subtxt you will find places where you can submit feedback on the AI performance. Often taking the shape of a "thumbs-up" ot "thumbs-down", your approval or disapproval of a response _teaches_ the AI how to be smarter at its job.

Subtxt is a constantly evolving, eternally updating narrative application. Your feedback and recommendations make the service even better for the next writer.
