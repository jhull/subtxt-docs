title: Focus and Flow
description: Tools for balancing intuitive creativity and deliberate storytelling refinement
---

Effortless inspiration one moment, deliberate refinement the next—this dynamic defines the creative process. In psychology, these modes are known as **System 1** (fast, intuitive thinking) and **System 2** (slow, deliberate reasoning). Subtxt embraces this duality, providing tools to support both **Flow** and **Focus**, two essential perspectives for crafting compelling and meaningful stories.  

#### **What Are Flow and Focus?**  

- **Flow**: The space for fast, intuitive, and creative brainstorming. Powered by GPT-4o from OpenAI, Flow encourages uninhibited idea generation—perfect for when inspiration strikes.  
- **Focus**: The mode for slow, deliberate narrative refinement. Leveraging OpenAI’s o1 model, Focus ensures your story structure is logical, cohesive, and polished to perfection.  

This balance allows Subtxt to meet you where you are in your creative journey, whether you’re generating bold ideas or honing intricate storylines.

When your story needs structure, logic, and clarity, Focus provides the precision required. This mode is excellent for:
