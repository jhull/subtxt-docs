## Cascading Context in Subtxt AI Tools

Subtxt AI tools use a **cascading fallback process** to ensure consistency and thematic relevance during idea generation. Each step represents a more general fallback, drawing from the most detailed context available to maintain accuracy and relevance.

### Cascading Context Hierarchy:

1. **Logline**: 
   - The broadest narrative context.
   - Used as a last fallback if no more specific information exists.

2. **Four Throughlines**:
   - Breaks the logline into distinct narrative perspectives, such as the Main Character, Influence Character, Overall Story, and Relationship.

3. **Individual Perspectives**:
   - Focuses on Throughline-specific viewpoints to clarify story development.

4. **Storypoints**:
   - Key thematic elements for each Throughline, such as the Concern, Issue, and Problem. These guide more granular narrative elements.

5. **Storypoint Synopses**:
   - Summaries at the Storypoints tab level. **This is the first source for generation** to ensure ideas align closely with your story.

6. **Storybeat Generation**:
   - Builds specific narrative moments within the larger story framework.

7. **Story**:
   - Synthesizes all the above elements into a cohesive whole.

### Storybeat Generation Process:

When Subtxt generates Storybeats, it **falls back in stages**:

1. **Primary Source**:  
   - **Storypoint Synopsis**: Found at the top of the Storypoints tab, this is the most detailed and specific source.
2. **Fallback 1**:  
   - **Throughline Perspective**: If no Storypoint Synopsis exists, Subtxt looks to the Throughline-level description for guidance.
3. **Fallback 2**:  
   - **Logline**: If neither of the above exists, the system defaults to the general logline, generating content based on overarching story goals and themes.

This cascading structure ensures that Subtxt AI tools always use the most specific and relevant information available, resorting to broader sources only when necessary. By working from the detailed to the general, the tools maintain coherence and alignment with your intended story vision.
