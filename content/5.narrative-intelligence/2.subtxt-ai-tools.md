Subtxt provides a suite of four AI-powered tools designed to support every stage of your storytelling process. These tools leverage decades of narrative theory and creative expertise, offering both inspiration and guidance to help you craft compelling stories. The available tools include:

- **BrainstormingAI**: Generates creative ideas for your Storypoints and Storybeats.  
- **DevelopAI**: Collaborates with Subtxt Muse for personalized story advice.  
- **ReviewAI**: Analyzes and provides immediate feedback on your storytelling.  
- **SubtextAI**: Offers detailed insights into narrative theory and thematic structure.

## BrainstormingAI  

BrainstormingAI is seamlessly integrated into the Subtxt interface, found beneath the Storytelling box of each Throughline, Storypoint, and Storybeat. Represented by a digital brain icon, this tool enables you to generate ideas tailored to specific parts of your story.  

### Using BrainstormingAI  

1. **Generating Ideas**  
   Click the Brainstorming AI button to open the Ideas drawer. If the Ideas box is empty, BrainstormingAI will generate suggestions based on the current Storypoint or Storybeat.  

2. **Customizing Inputs**  
   Add your own notes, character names, or concepts to the Ideas box. BrainstormingAI will incorporate your input into its suggestions for a more personalized output.  

3. **Iterating and Refining**  
   Select the Brainstorming AI button multiple times to refine or expand on generated ideas. Experiment until the results align with your creative vision.  

4. **Integrating Content**  
   Click the **Add** button to copy the generated content directly into the Storytelling box.  

5. **Requesting Variations**  
   You can instruct BrainstormingAI to generate multiple ideas at once, giving you options to choose from.  

### The Brainstorming AI Factor  

At the top right of the screen, the **Brainstorming AI Factor slider** allows you to control the creativity of the tool’s suggestions:  
- Sliding toward **Most Probable** generates grounded, conventional ideas.  
- Sliding toward **Most Impossible** unlocks more unconventional and innovative suggestions.  

This slider is also available in your Writings > Preferences page and influences all Narrative Agent outputs.  

## DevelopAI  

DevelopAI is your portal to working directly with Subtxt Muse for expert advice on developing and refining story elements. Located between the Brainstorming AI button and the Storytelling box, DevelopAI enhances your storytelling with real-time, tailored support.  

### Using DevelopAI  

1. **Engaging Muse**  
   Select the DevelopAI button to activate Muse. The tool automatically gathers relevant context from your Storypoint or Storybeat.  

2. **Providing Context**  
   Add any additional details or questions to guide Muse’s response. You can ask for an explanation of your story element or dive into specific brainstorming.  

3. **Collaborating with Muse**  
   Engage in a productive, back-and-forth conversation. Muse can assist with explanations, suggestions, or live brainstorming for richer development.  

4. **Incorporating Suggestions**  
   Copy Muse’s response using the clipboard icon and paste it into your Storytelling box for seamless integration.  

Muse’s awareness of your entire Storyform allows for nuanced, informed advice that aligns with your overarching narrative structure.  

## ReviewAI  

ReviewAI provides quick, actionable feedback on your storytelling. It ensures your illustrations and content align with your narrative goals, helping you improve and move forward with confidence.  

### Using ReviewAI  

1. **Submitting Work**  
   After adding Storytelling to a Storypoint or Storybeat, click the **Review** button.  

2. **Receiving Feedback**  
   Muse will analyze your content and provide suggestions for improvement or confirm that your work is effective as is.  

3. **Improving Illustrations**  
   ReviewAI also helps refine illustrations by comparing them to a vast database of examples. Suggestions focus on enhancing thematic depth and narrative clarity.  
   
## SubtextAI  

SubtextAI is your gateway to understanding the deeper narrative principles behind your story. This tool, located next to your Writing Prompt, expands on the purpose of each Storypoint or Storybeat and connects it to the thematic framework of your story.  

### Features of SubtextAI  

- **Detailed Writing Prompts**  
  SubtextAI explains the role and purpose of specific story elements, helping you understand how they fit into the broader narrative structure.  

- **Examples from Storyforms**  
  It compares your work to similar films, novels, and television series to provide relatable examples and inspiration.  

- **Contextualized Insights**  
  SubtextAI links narrative theory to your specific story, offering explanations in direct relation to your content.  

DevelopAI is also accessible from SubtextAI, enabling you to explore and expand upon the detailed insights provided.  

## Cascading Context: How Subtxt AI Generates Content  

Subtxt AI tools rely on a **cascading fallback process** to create contextually accurate and thematically relevant content. This process ensures the AI uses the most detailed information available, falling back to broader sources when necessary.

### Hierarchy of Cascading Context  

1. **Storypoint Synopsis**  
   The most specific and detailed information available, located at the top of the Storypoints tab. This is the primary source for generation.  

2. **Throughline Perspective**  
   If no Storypoint Synopsis is available, Subtxt falls back to the description of the relevant Throughline.  

3. **Logline**  
   If neither of the above exists, the AI defaults to the overarching logline for guidance.  

### Example of Storybeat Generation  

When generating Storybeats, Subtxt will:  
- First, pull from the **Storypoint Synopsis** for precise guidance.  
- If unavailable, it will use the **Throughline Perspective** to maintain a narrower focus.  
- As a last resort, it will rely on the **Logline**, drawing from the broadest context of your story.  

This structured fallback ensures that Subtxt tools adapt to varying levels of story detail, always aiming to produce coherent and aligned outputs.  

## Behind the Scenes: The Power of Subtxt AI  

Subtxt AI combines cutting-edge technology with a deep understanding of narrative principles.  

- **BrainstormingAI** relies on existing Storytelling to provide informed, tailored suggestions. If no specific context is available, it uses a general narrative framework for guidance.  

- **Subtxt Muse** builds upon BrainstormingAI with additional resources, including decades of narrative research, user insights, and successful story examples. Muse’s comprehensive capabilities enable it to deliver nuanced and context-rich responses.  

Whether you are brainstorming ideas, refining story elements, or seeking expert feedback, Subtxt AI tools adapt to your needs, providing creative support every step of the way.
