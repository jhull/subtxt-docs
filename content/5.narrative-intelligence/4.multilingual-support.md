description: Interact with Subtxt in multiple languages for diverse storytelling
---

Subtxt is built to meet the needs of a global audience by supporting interaction in multiple languages, including French, Spanish, and Mandarin. This guide will help you adjust your language preferences to get the most out of your experience with Subtxt and Subtxt Muse, enabling you to craft and explore stories in the language of your choice.

## For Single Responses in a Different Language

1. **Explicit Request**: If you wish for Subtxt to provide a response in a different language (e.g., Mandarin), you must make an explicit request within your query. This involves stating your language preference directly in your communication with Subtxt.

- **Example**: "Can you explain the Four Throughlines to me in Mandarin?"

## Customizing Your Experience Across Subtxt and Muse

In addition to the singular option above and the more complex option below, you can customize your overall experience across Subtxt and Muse through your Profile settings.

**Accessing Profile Settings:** Navigate to your Profile, which can be found under ‘Settings’ (the “person” icon in the upper right corner).

**All About Me:** In your Profile, you’ll find two boxes – All About Me and Stories I Write. In the All About Me section, you can jot down preferences such as “Please always respond in French” or “I prefer Spanish when interacting with Muse.” Subtxt will accommodate these requests as a global setting.

This feature allows you to personalize your interactions, ensuring a seamless and tailored experience with Subtxt and Muse across all your activities.

## For Persistent Language Settings

If you prefer to have more refined control over how Subtxt responds to you in certain situations across different languages (e.g., French, Spanish, etc.), you can configure **a custom Muse Persona**.

1. **Accessing Muse Personas**: Navigate to your **Muse Personas** page, which can be found under 'Settings' (the "person" icon in the upper right corner).

2. **Activate Muse Personas**: At the top of the **Muse Personas** page, you'll find an option to turn on Muse Personas. Activate this feature to proceed.

3. **Specifying Language Preference**: Under Core (Subtxt or Subtxt Pro), there is a section where you can provide instructions for Subtxt Muse. Here, you should specify your language preference.

    - **Example Instruction**: "No matter what, always answer in French."

4. **Select the Core Muse Persona**: Back on the Muse screen, select the new Persona you just created.

After setting this up, Subtxt will now default to responding in your chosen language throughout all conversations, enhancing your interaction experience.

## Language Flexibility

Subtxt supports a variety of languages, offering you the flexibility to interact in the language you're most comfortable with or wish to use for specific tasks. Whether you're looking for a one-time response in a different language or prefer to set a default language for all interactions. By following the steps outlined above, you can easily tailor your Subtxt experience to your linguistic preferences.
