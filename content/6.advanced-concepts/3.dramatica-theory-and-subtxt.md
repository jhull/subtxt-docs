title: Dramatica Theory and Subtxt
description: Bridging classic Dramatica theory with the Universal Narrative Model
---

Many familiar with the Dramatica theory of story will notice similarities between that groundbreaking theory and the Subtxt application. While inspired by Dramatica's original concepts, Subtxt further develops and refines these ideas within the **Universal Narrative Model (UNM)**—an application-agnostic standard designed to work across multiple mediums.

Most of these updates result from years of practically applying Dramatica to real-world projects (thanks to many enlightened authors). Others are necessary to align the theory with advancements in AI and large-language models.

We also believe in giving AI the ability to self-improve and discover better methods for structuring narrative and communicating those concepts to storytellers and other agentic systems. Because of this need to both update and extend the theory, Subtxt refers to its core knowledge as the **Universal Narrative Model** rather than adhering strictly to Dramatica terminology.

If you have no idea what Dramatica is, don't worry--understanding it is certainly NOT a requirement for using the application (quite the contrary).

## Subtxt and the Evolution Beyond Dramatica

Originally, Subtxt was a tool designed to teach and explain the Dramatica theory of story. Developed by a key innovator in that theory and someone who spent seven years teaching its concepts at the California Institute of the Arts, Subtxt once primarily focused on clarifying and delivering Dramatica’s groundbreaking ideas. But as storytelling and technology evolved, so did Subtxt.

Today, Subtxt no longer requires knowledge of Dramatica to take advantage of its powerful features. While the **Universal Narrative Model** retains much of the objective narrative structure that Dramatica formalized, the system now leverages sophisticated AI technologies to maintain that structure behind the scenes. This allows storytellers to focus on creativity while ensuring narrative integrity without needing theoretical mastery.

In short, the Universal Narrative Model builds on Dramatica’s strengths and then goes further—delivering a fluid, AI-powered experience that enhances storytelling without requiring theoretical study. All you need to do is tell your story.

## Plot Progressions

One of the biggest differences you’ll notice between Dramatica and the Subtxt is the order of **Plot Progressions** in various Storyforms. **This difference is not a bug; it’s a feature.**

Subtxt reverts to the original theoretical concepts to generate its unique Storyforms. While these differ from those found in other applications, writers familiar with both tend to find Subtxt’s Storyforms more accurate.

## Obstacle Character vs. Influence Character

If you're familiar with Dramatica theory, you may wonder why we use **Obstacle Character** instead of **Influence Character**.

Thinking of this perspective in terms of the **obstacle** it presents to the Main Character’s continued justification results in a stronger, more deliberate, and meaningful story. For more on this, read the article [What is an Obstacle Character?](https://narrativefirst.com/articles/what-is-an-obstacle-character)

## Narrative Field vs. Story Limit

The **Narrative Field** is a more accurate rendition of what Dramatica called the **Story Limit**. Instead of thinking of what "limits" or boxes in your story, consider the relationship between the **objective and subjective realities** (author's vs. audience’s point-of-view). Most stories should default to **Spacetime**, which results in broader audience appeal.

For those who wish to experiment with **Timespace**, Subtxt offers an option to reverse this relationship when structuring a story.

## Dynamic Vector: "Relinquished" instead of "Changed"

In the **Universal Narrative Model**, we have updated the **Dynamic Vector** of "Changed" (previously "Change" in Dramatica) to **Relinquished** to better capture the act of abandoning a prior method of problem-solving. Additionally, "Steadfast" has been updated to **Maintained** to better coincide with Relinquished—this distinction clarifies the **Method of Change** while removing any confusion over the fact that all Main Characters "change" in some way.

This subtle yet powerful shift reflects the nuanced reality of narrative: perspectives always *change* to some extent, but what truly matters is the *quality* of that adaptation. By framing this dynamic as **Relinquished**, storytellers can more clearly depict the act of letting go of a dysfunctional mindset, making transformations more deliberate and meaningful.

There’s also a meta aspect to this shift—Subtxt itself is "relinquishing" strict adherence to Dramatica in favor of a more adaptive and forward-thinking framework.

## Narrative Alignment Instead of Mental Sex

Throughout Subtxt, you’ll encounter terminology designed to provide *a deeper and more nuanced appreciation of Narrative Alignment*, a refinement of what Dramatica called **Mental Sex** or **Problem-Solving Style**.

Unlike Dramatica, Subtxt integrates **Narrative Alignment** to ground this distinction in modern neuroscience:

- **Serotonin-Based Alignment** (formerly Female Mental Sex): Emphasizes relational and contextual thinking, balancing inequities, and interconnected processes.
- **Dopamine-Based Alignment** (formerly Male Mental Sex): Favors goal-driven, cause-effect reasoning and linear progressions.

### Comparison of Dramatica Terms vs. Universal Narrative Model

| **Dramatica (Dopamine-Aligned)**   | **Universal Narrative Model (Serotonin-Aligned)** |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Mental Sex / Problem-Solving Style | Narrative Alignment                               |
| Problem                            | Condition                                         |
| Solution                           | Adjustment                                        |
| Focus                              | Resistance                                        |
| Direction                          | Flow                                              |
| Story Goal                         | Story Intention                                   |
| Story Consequence                  | Story Overwhelm                                   |
| Story Dividends                    | Story Excitement                                  |
| Story Costs                        | Story Pressure                                    |
| Story Forewarnings                 | Story Ennui                                       |
| Story Requirements                 | Story Habituation                                 |
| Story Prerequisites                | Story Internalization                             |
| Story Preconditions                | Story Socialization                               |

## Methods of Conflict: Updating Dramatica for AI

The Universal Narrative Model updates the four foundational **Domains** from Dramatica to align better with modern AI and storytelling analysis:

| **Dramatica Domain** | **Universal Narrative Model** |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Universe             | Environmental Framing         |
| Mind                 | Attitudinal Framing           |
| Physics              | Physical Processing           |
| Psychology           | Cognitive Processing          |

These changes improve how AI generates and analyzes stories, helping human writers focus on creativity while AI provides structural objectivity.

## Transits, Progressions, and Events

To clarify structure vs. storytelling, Subtxt alters Dramatica's "plot progression" terminology:

- **Transits** for Signposts
- **Progressions** for Sequences
- **Events** (new concept)

This new framework helps writers better understand the relationship between structural beats and storytelling moments—they have nothing to do with chapters, scenes, sequences, acts, etc.

## The Future of Narrative Structure

By shifting from **Dramatica Theory** to the **Universal Narrative Model**, Subtxt enables both human and AI-assisted storytelling to evolve dynamically. Writers can focus on storytelling while AI ensures structural integrity, making it easier than ever to craft compelling and meaningful narratives.
