description: Analyze storytelling elements for thematic conflict alignment based on the Universal Narrative Model
---

Subtxt is designed to support narrative analysis by identifying the core sources of conflict within storytelling that fall within the range of the Universal Narrative Model standard. With this, writers and developers can evaluate key elements for thematic coherence, enabling more compelling, cohesive stories. The Evaluations endpoint makes this framework accessible for integration into applications, allowing users to objectively measure and refine narrative components according to thematic conflict sources.

## Using the Evaluations Endpoint

To analyze a storytelling element, you can submit a POST request to the Evaluations endpoint. This request requires specifying a conflict method and a block of storytelling text, which Subtxt will evaluate to determine if the narrative effectively illustrates the thematic conflict. A higher score indicates that the storytelling is a strong match for the chosen method of conflict.

## API Endpoint

URL: `https://api.subtxt.app/api/v1/evaluate/storytelling`

## Parameters

The `evaluate/storytelling` endpoint requires two parameters:

| Parameter           | Type     | Description                                                                                  |
| ------------------- | :------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `method_of_conflict` | `string` | Represents the thematic method of conflict you want to evaluate within the storytelling. Options include **Disbelief**, **Environmental Framing**, **Accurate**, and **State of Being** among others defined in Subtxtâ€™s framework. |
| `storytelling`       | `string` | The narrative text to be evaluated for the presence and strength of the specified conflict method. |

## Request Example

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.subtxt.app/api/v1/evaluate/storytelling \
-H "Authorization: Bearer your-token-here" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
        "method_of_conflict": "Disbelief",
        "storytelling": "Josephine tells Margaret that she is totally skeptical of anyone she has never met before, and would prefer to make her own decisions."
    }'
```



## Sample Responses and Interpretation

### Sample 1: A Strong Match

In this example, the request includes **Control** as the `method_of_conflict` and storytelling text that reflects a clear exercise of control in a dramatic context.

```json
{
    "method_of_conflict": "Control",
    "storytelling": "directing the group towards certain death"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
    "approved": true,
    "evaluation": "Good illustration",
    "score": 0.863622427
}
```

A high score of `0.863622427` indicates that the narrative effectively captures the theme of **Control**, reinforcing the thematic intent.

### Sample 2: An Average Match

Here, the `method_of_conflict` is set to **Disbelief**, with storytelling that conveys some skepticism but lacks depth in illustrating the conflict.

```json
{
    "method_of_conflict": "Disbelief",
    "storytelling": "Josephine tells Margaret that she is totally skeptical of anyone she has never met before."
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
    "approved": true,
    "evaluation": "Passable",
    "score": 0.85238117
}
```

This score indicates the storytelling is adequate but may benefit from deeper exploration of the **Disbelief** theme to better align with the conflict type.

### Sample 3: A Weak Match

In this example, **Actuality** is chosen as the `method_of_conflict`, with storytelling that does not clearly convey the conflict type.

```json
{
    "method_of_conflict": "Actuality",
    "storytelling": "Josephine freaks out and runs around the library like a maniac."
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
    "approved": false,
    "evaluation": "Complete denial",
    "score": 0.777258813
}
```

Here, the lower score (`0.777258813`) and the evaluation of "Complete denial" suggest the storytelling does not adequately illustrate the **Actuality** conflict, indicating a need for refinement.

## Summary

The Evaluations endpoint offers an objective assessment of thematic conflict within storytelling. By using the `method_of_conflict` and `storytelling` parameters, you can integrate powerful thematic evaluations into your narrative tools and workflows. This endpoint not only helps assess storytelling elements but also serves as a guide to enhance the depth and effectiveness of thematic representation in narratives.
