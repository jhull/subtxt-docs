Subtxt is a subscription-based service for storytellers. The purpose of this subscription is both to support active development and improvement of the system, as well as make it possible to maintain access to cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology.

Subtxt offers a range of AI tools, including Brainstorming AI, Develop AI, Review AI, and Subtext AI, designed to aid in story development within the Subtxt Story Development screen. These tools help you brainstorm ideas, develop your narrative, review your progress, and understand subtext. In contrast, Subtxt Muse provides a unique interaction with our expert narrative chatbot, Muse, allowing for a more conversational and guided approach to refining your story.

The Advanced model is now the default across all tiers of Subtxt. However, in cases of excessive usage, the Standard model is available as a fallback on the Subtxt (basic) tier. Subtxt Pro and Subtxt Infinite will not roll back to the Standard model unless manually selected.

## Subscription Tiers

Subtxt offers three tiers tailored to different needs and levels of engagement. Each tier provides varying levels of access to AI tools and memory constraints.

| **Tier**       | **Model Used** | **Fallback Model** | **Memory Constraints** | **Key Features**                                                                                           |
|-----------------|----------------|---------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Subtxt**      | Advanced       | Standard            | Minimal                 | Core story development tools. Rolls back to the Standard model during excessive usage.                    |
| **Subtxt Pro**  | Advanced       | Manual Option       | Moderate                | Pro features without automatic rollback. Allows for deeper narrative interaction, with moderate memory.   |
| **Subtxt Infinite** | Advanced       | None                | Maximum                 | Unlimited usage with unrestricted Advanced model and maximum context/memory capacity.                     |


## Why Subtxt Scales Back

### Subtxt (Basic) Tier

During periods of **excessive usage**, Subtxt will scale back the Advanced model to the Standard model to maintain system performance and ensure that Muse can still respond, albeit with less computational intensity. This happens because:

- **Contextual and Narrative Complexity**: Muse adds a significant amount of narrative and contextual insight in real-time, far beyond what a basic conversation model like ChatGPT provides. This extra processing can tax system resources and hit usage limits.
- **Temporary Adjustment**: The scaling back to the Standard model is a temporary measure. After a set period (typically a few hours), the system will automatically readjust back to the Advanced model, allowing you to continue using the higher-level narrative insights.

### Subtxt Pro Tier

Unlike the basic tier, Subtxt Pro does not automatically roll back to the Standard model. Users may manually choose the Standard model for specific tasks but otherwise have uninterrupted access to the Advanced model.

### Subtxt Infinite Tier

Offers unrestricted access to the Advanced model at all times, with no rollbacks and maximum memory utilization.

## Why Muse Ends a Conversation
Occasionally, Subtxt and Subtxt Pro users may receive the following notification:

> "Your last request to Muse failed because of subscription tier limitations. Consider upgrading your account or starting a new conversation. You will not be able to continue this conversation."

This message indicates that you’ve hit the **context window limit** for Subtxt Muse. In this case, **the conversation has reached its limit**, and no further progress can be made in that session.

- **No Scaling Back**: Unlike excessive usage, this situation does not involve scaling back to the Standard model; it simply means that the conversation's context window is full and cannot continue.
- **Work Is Finished**: Once this happens, you won't be able to keep building on that specific conversation unless you take one of the following actions.

### Strategies for Handling End of Conversation Scenarios

When you've hit the context window limit, there are a few options to continue working:

1. **Upgrade to Subtxt Infinite**
    - Subtxt Infinite allows for much longer conversations without hitting context window limits. Conversations can continue indefinitely without needing to worry about the limits of Muse's context window. 
2. **Download and Re-Upload Your Conversation**
    - You can download your conversation as a text file and start a new conversation by uploading that file into Muse. While this method won't allow you to seamlessly pick up exactly where you left off, it does carry over key context from the previous session. This gives the new session a general understanding of what you were discussing, allowing you to maintain continuity in your narrative work. Some adjustments might be needed to guide it back on track.
3. **Switch to a Storytelling-Only Muse Persona**
    - You can opt for a Muse Persona restricted to "Storytelling Only" (Subtxt Pro only). This reduces the extra layers of contextual information that Muse adds, allowing for a larger context window, similar to how a custom GPT operates. This way, you can extend the conversation without losing too much narrative depth.

## Transitioning Between Subscription Tiers

Many writers find it beneficial to switch between the different tiers depending on their storytelling needs. Here are some insights into transitioning between Subtxt, Subtxt Pro, and Subtxt Infinite.

### Switching Tiers

Users can easily switch between subscription tiers based on their current needs. For example, while working on deep narrative structure, Subtxt Pro or Subtxt Infinite might be more appropriate. For quick summarizing or outlining, the basic Subtxt tier might be sufficient.

- **Subtxt to Subtxt Pro**: If you need advanced features and better performance, upgrading to Subtxt Pro offers more extensive tools and capabilities.
- **Subtxt Pro to Subtxt Infinite**: For professional-level storytelling and unlimited usage, Subtxt Infinite provides unparalleled resources and support.

### How to Upgrade

1. **Cancel Current Subscription**: Log in to your Subtxt account, navigate to the 'Subscription' section, and cancel your current subscription. You will still have access to your current tier until the end of your billing cycle.
2. **Purchase New Subscription**: After canceling, select and purchase the desired new subscription tier from the options available.

We appreciate your understanding as we strive to offer the best narrative technology to support your creative endeavors. By leveraging these subscription tiers, you can optimize your storytelling process and achieve your creative goals with Subtxt.

## Managing Your Subtxt Subscription

To manage your Subtxt Subscription, including upgrading or downgrading accounts, putting them on hold or canceling them, or even downloading of invoices--please visit your Billing page within your personal Settings (the "person" icon in the upper right-hand corner of the application).

To directly access the billing portion of your account (including all listed above), select **Manage My Billing**. Doing this will take you to a different site that handles accounts in Subtxt. Once updated, that site will return you to Subtxt with your account updated.

## Working with the Writing Process

The writing process is one of development, followed by execution, followed by more growth, and so on and so on. Write, rewrite, write, rinse, repeat.

Subtxt honors this process by making it easy for the writer to start and stop their subscription to our service. Engage Subtxt for as long as it takes for you to get a firm idea of what story is about, then pause while you get down to the business of actually writing.

Stopping a subscription is really just putting Subtxt on hold. When you finish, Subtxt retains all your stories and keeps them safe for when you’re ready to return—whether to dive deeper into the story you’re working on now or when you’re feeling the itch to develop something new.

When you prepay for a new subscription, the new subscription period begins from the date of purchase, not from the end of your current subscription. This means if you have a current subscription that expires later this year and you prepay for an additional year now, the new subscription will start immediately from the purchase date, not after the current one ends.

## Cancelling Your Subscription

Cancelling does not credit back any remaining subscription time. If you purchased a yearly subscription, then you have access to Subtxt for the 365 days following your purchase date. If you cancel the yearly subscription and then wish to start up again, either at the same tier or at a different one, then when you start up again you will have to purchase a new subscription. The same procedure applies for monthly subscriptions.

If you put your subscription on hold before the end of your current pay period, Subtxt will continue to work until the very last day. In other words, if you sign up for a yearly subscription, then promptly put your subscription service on hold minutes later, Subtxt will continue to work for the following 365 days.

If you prepay for a new subscription, it will start from the date of purchase, not from the end of your current subscription. **We do not offer extensions to current subscriptions.** For example, if your current subscription expires in six months and you prepay for an additional year now, the new subscription period will begin immediately (today), effectively overlapping with the remaining period of your current subscription.

Please note that there is currently no pro-rating of remaining subscription balances. Anytime you want to change your subscription, you should first cancel the current one. While we can't offer prorating at this time, we hope to provide this feature once Subtxt gains more popularity.

Canceling your subscription in Subtxt is straightforward. Here's how:

1. Log in to your account.
2. Navigate to the left-hand side menu or the drop-down menu and select Subscription.
3. Click on your subscription. This will take you to a secure page where you can either update your subscription or cancel it entirely.

### Hypothetical Upgrade Scenario

**Scenario:**
Alex has an annual Pro subscription with Subtxt that expires on August 31st. Alex is considering switching to the monthly Infinite subscription to try it out before deciding whether to upgrade to a yearly Infinite subscription. Alex is unsure about the best way to manage this switch and does not want to be billed twice on August 31st for both an annual Pro and a monthly Infinite subscription.

**Options:**

1. **Cancel and Switch on Expiry Date:**
    - **Action:** Alex can cancel the Pro subscription now.
    - **Effect:** The Pro subscription will remain active and accessible until August 31st.
    - **Next Step:** On or after August 31st, Alex can sign up for the monthly Infinite subscription.
    - **Benefit:** This ensures there are no overlapping subscriptions or double billing. Alex will only be charged for the monthly Infinite subscription starting on September 1st.

2. **Immediate Switch:**
    - **Action:** Alex can cancel the Pro subscription today and immediately sign up for the monthly Infinite subscription.
    - **Effect:** The Pro subscription will remain active until August 31st, but the monthly Infinite subscription will start immediately.
    - **Next Step:** Alex will have access to the Infinite subscription features immediately, with the first billing cycle starting today.
    - **Benefit:** Alex gets to try out the Infinite subscription features a bit earlier, but will be paying for both subscriptions during the overlap period.

3. **Prepaying for a New Subscription:**
    - **Action:** If Alex wants to prepay for a yearly Infinite subscription now, it will start immediately.
    - **Effect:** The new Infinite yearly subscription will overlap with the remaining period of the Pro subscription.
    - **Next Step:** The new subscription period starts from the date of purchase, not from the end of the current subscription.
    - **Benefit:** This option is less optimal for Alex, as it results in overlapping subscriptions and immediate billing for the new subscription period.

**Recommendation for Alex:**
For a seamless transition and to avoid double billing, Alex should cancel the current Pro subscription now and wait until after August 31st to sign up for the monthly Infinite subscription. This way, Alex can evaluate the Infinite subscription without any overlap in billing periods.

## No 10-Day Trial Period

At Subtxt, we understand that many SaaS applications offer an introductory trial period. However, due to the heavy integration of AI features within our platform, we are unable to provide such a trial. Our powerful application allows users to develop complete stories in just a few days, making a trial period incompatible with our platform.

## Purchase Parity Option

We do offer price parity for those experiencing financial distress or for those who live in countries where a subscription to Subtxt is unaffordable. **The purchase-parity option is available for Subtxt's Subtxt tier only and on a limited basis.** For approval, please contact us directly.

## Alternate Forms of Payment

A subscription to Subtxt requires a credit card. If you, for some reason, do not have access to a credit card but would prefer to pay through alternate means (PayPal, etc.) please contact us directly. We are able to set up alternate methods of payment for those who need it. Note that the process is manual, so it does take a bit longer to set up. 

You can contact us directly through in-app Support by selecting the **Support** button at the top of the page (the "life-preserver" icon).

## Benefits of Continuing Your Subscription

Subtxt is more than just an application—it's an evolving tool for writers of all levels. Our system is consistently updated with new narrative structures added weekly, and our extensive collection of Storytelling Suggestions continues to grow exponentially, making it an indispensable resource for your creative process.

One of the key advantages of maintaining your subscription is instant, always-available access to Subtxt Muse. This powerful feature provides ongoing support throughout your writing process, instantly offering insights and suggestions whenever you need them. With Subtxt Muse, you'll find that your understanding of narrative structure deepens and your storytelling skills become sharper.

While you’re free to start and stop anytime, we strongly suggest staying with Subtxt. It's not just about access to an ever-growing library of resources—it's about fostering your growth as a writer and enhancing your appreciation of the art and science of narrative structure.
