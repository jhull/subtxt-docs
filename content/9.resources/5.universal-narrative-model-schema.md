title: Universal Narrative Model JSON Scheme
description: A standardized JSON format for structuring narrative elements, enabling consistency, interoperability, and adaptability across storytelling platforms.
---

The **Universal Narrative Model JSON Schema** provides a standardized format for defining and organizing story elements in a structured, interoperable way. This schema allows narratives to be stored, analyzed, and transferred between different storytelling tools while maintaining **clarity, flexibility, and the author's original intent**.

At its core, the schema divides a story into two layers: the **deep, structural meaning (Subtext)** and the **surface-level presentation (Storytelling)**. This split ensures that authors can preserve the underlying message of their work while allowing for various forms of high-level audience engagement.

---

## **Schema Validation & Usage**  

The JSON Schema is designed for **broad adoption** and can be validated using any **JSON Schema validation tool**. It can be used in:  

- **Storytelling platforms** (Subtxt, AI-driven tools, screenwriting apps)  
- **APIs** that facilitate structured narrative generation  
- **AI models** that generate structured story data  
- **Interactive storytelling** systems (video games, branching narratives) 

---

## **Extending the Model**  

The Universal Narrative Model is **designed for flexibility**. Developers and storytellers can:  

- Add **custom Appreciations, Methods, Dynamics, and Vectors** using `custom_appreciation`, `custom_method`, `custom_dynamic`, and `custom_vector` fields.  
- Map terms from other storytelling frameworks using `custom_appreciation_namespace`, `custom_method_namespace`, `custom_dynamic_namespace`, and `custom_vector_namespace`.  
- Submit **extensions and feedback** via the Subtxt documentation repo.

---

## **Schema Overview**  

The schema is divided into the following key sections:

### Story 
The highest-level object representing the entire story, containing its metadata and core narrative structure.  

#### **Story Properties:**  
- `id`: Unique story identifier  
- `title`: Story title  
- `genre`: Story genre  
- `logline`: A short description of the story’s premise  
- `created_at`: Timestamp for record-keeping  

```json
"story": {
  "id": "story_123e4567",
  "title": "The Journey Within",
  "genre": "Psychological Drama",
  "logline": "A psychologist struggling with his past helps a patient uncover a hidden trauma, only to confront his own.",
  "created_at": "2025-02-05T14:30:00Z"
}
```

Inside a story, the **narrative** is broken down into two layers: **Subtext** and **Storytelling.**

---

### Narrative: Structuring Subtext & Storytelling  

A **story** may contain **one or more narratives**, though most stories exhibit a **single central narrative**. Each narrative is composed of two core layers:  

1. **Subtext:** The deep, underlying structure of the narrative that conveys the author's intent.  
2. **Storytelling:** The high-level, audience-facing presentation of the story.  

This structure provides both depth (meaning) and flexibility (presentation) within a single, organized model, ensuring a clear distinction between **what the story means** (Subtext) and **how the story is told** (Storytelling).  

---

```json
"story": {
  "id": "story_123e4567",
  "title": "The Journey Within",
  "narratives": [
    {
        "id": "narrative_AbnHJ147",
        "title": "Central Form",
        "subtext": {
            "perspectives": [],
            "players": [],
            "storypoints": [],
            "storybeats": [],
            "dynamics": []
        },
        "storytelling": {
            "overviews": [],
            "moments": []
        }
    }
  ]
}
```
---

## Structuring Subtext vs. Storytelling  

### **Subtext** – The deep, underlying message of the narrative that communicates the author's intent.  
Subtext is composed of core structural components that define meaning beneath the surface:  
- **Perspectives** – The lens through which story elements are experienced (e.g., `Objective Story`, `Main Character`).  
- **Dynamics** – High-level narrative forces like `Story Outcome` (`Success` or `Failure`).
- **Players** – Characters with defined roles and motivations that impact the story's underlying meaning.  
- **Storypoints** – Key structural points, such as `Problem`, `Solution`, and `Story Goal`.  
- **Storybeats** – Significant turning points that reflect shifts in narrative meaning, such as `Transit`, `Progression`, or `Event`.  

---

### **Storytelling** – The high-level, audience-facing presentation of the narrative.  
This is how the story is structured and told, with organizational and stylistic elements that shape audience perception:  
- **Overviews** – Surface-level storytelling components. The only standard Overviews are **Logline** and **Genre Dynamics**.
- **Moments** – Organizational units (such as scenes, sequences, acts, chapters, sections, or levels) that define the telling of the narrative. Each Moment includes a `synopsis` and reference to ordered Storybeats found within.

## Summary of the Narrative Structure
| Section        | Purpose                          | Key Elements                           |
|----------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Subtext**     | Deep, underlying narrative meaning | Perspectives, Players, Storypoints, Storybeats, Dynamics |
| **Storytelling**| Surface-level narrative presentation | Overviews, Moments                      |

---

### Subtext (Deep Narrative Structure)
This section represents the **core meaning** of the story.

#### **Perspectives**  
The lens through which the audience experiences the story’s **meaning**.  

```json
"perspectives": [
  {
    "id": "perspective_ab12cd34",
    "name": "Main Character",
    "description": "The perspective from which the audience experiences the story.",
    "throughline": "Main Character"
  }
]
```

#### **Players**  
Characters within the **narrative structure**, with motivations tied to **subtext** rather than superficial characterization. The associated Perspective MUST be associated with an `Objective Story` Throughline.

```json
"players": [
  {
    "id": "player_98abcd76",
    "name": "Dr. Michael Hayes",
    "role": "Main Character",
    "summary": "A psychologist haunted by his past.",
    "storytelling": "Michael projects confidence while hiding his fears.",
    "perspective_id": "perspective_ab12cd34",
    "motivations": [
      {
        "method": "Avoidance",
        "illustration": "Michael avoids discussing his past by focusing on his patient.",
        "storytelling": "In therapy sessions, Michael steers conversations away from himself."
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

#### **Dynamics**  
High-level narrative forces like **Story Outcome** and **Story Judgment**.

```json
"dynamics": [
  {
    "id": "dynamic_abcdef12",
    "dynamic": "Story Outcome",
    "vector": "Success",
    "summary": "The story resolves with Michael embracing his past.",
    "storytelling": "Michael finally opens up, allowing his own progress.",
    "perspective_id": "perspective_ab12cd34"
  }
]
```

#### **Storypoints**  
Structured **spatial aspects** that define and shape the narrative.

```json
"storypoints": [
  {
    "id": "storypoint_2345abcd",
    "appreciation": "Main Character Issue",
    "method": "Rationalization",
    "illustration": "justifying bad behavior",
    "summary": "The character avoids self-examination by rationalizing past behavior.",
    "storytelling": "Michael takes charge, justifying his actions as necessary in order to take care of the family.",
    "perspective_id": "perspective_ab12cd34"
  }
]
```

#### **Storybeats**  
**Temporal aspects** that illustrate the progression _through_ the narrative. Each beat captures a **significant temporal shift** and exists within a defined **scope**.

#### **Special Keys for Storybeats**
- **`scope`** – Defines the narrative level the beat belongs to:
  - `"transit"` → **Broad thematic shifts** (1-4)
  - `"progression"` → **Structural developments** (1-16)
  - `"event"` → **Fine-grained events** (1-64)
- **`number`** – Canonical ordering within the **scope**.
- **`tones`** – Classifies the narrative function in three dimensions:
  - **Abstraction** → `"situation"`, `"action"`, `"justification"`, `"opinion"`
  - **Spatial** → `"potential"`, `"resistance"`, `"current"`, `"power"`
  - **Temporal** → `"expression"`, `"experimentation"`, `"integration"`, `"transcendence"`

These ensure **consistency across all stories** while allowing room for creative variation.

```json
"storybeats": [
  {
    "id": "storybeat_9876bcde",
    "appreciation": "Main Character Transit",
    "number": 4,
    "method": "Past",
    "illustration": "reliving the past",
    "summary": "Michael can no longer escape their past.",
    "storytelling": "During a session, Michael’s patient echoes words from his childhood trauma.",
    "scope": 1,
    "tones": {
        "abstraction": "situation",
        "spatial": "power",
        "temporal": "transcendence"
    },
    "perspective_id": "perspective_ab12cd34"
  }
]
```

---

### Storytelling (How the Narrative is Expressed)  
This section represents the **presentation, style, and organization** of the story.

#### **Overviews**  
**Surface-level components** like the **Logline** and **Genre Dynamics**.  

```json
"overviews": [
  {
    "id": "overview_12345abc",
    "storytelling": "A thrilling cat-and-mouse chase through the neon-lit streets of a futuristic city.",
    "summary": "A cyberpunk crime thriller about a rogue AI and the detective trying to stop it."
  },
  {
    "id": "overview_67890def",
    "storytelling": "Blending classic noir with futuristic dystopia, the story challenges conventional crime tropes.",
    "summary": "A fusion of cyberpunk and detective noir."
  }
]
```

#### **Moments**  
Organizational and supreficial **narrative units**—Acts, Scenes, Sequences, Chapters, Levels.  

```json
"moments": [
  {
    "id": "moment_abcdef12",
    "summary": "The protagonist arrives in the dystopian city and gets their first taste of the underworld.",
    "synopsis": "After landing in Neo-Tokyo, Alex is forced to navigate a world of hackers, crime syndicates, and AI-controlled law enforcement.",
    "storybeats": [
      { "order": 0, "storybeat_id": "storybeat_123456" },
      { "order": 1, "storybeat_id": "storybeat_789012" },
      { "order": 2, "storybeat_id": "storybeat_345678" }
    ]
  },
  {
    "id": "moment_ghijkl34",
    "summary": "A tense confrontation with the antagonist reveals a shocking truth.",
    "synopsis": "Alex finally meets the rogue AI and realizes it may not be the villain they were led to believe.",
    "storybeats": [
      { "order": 0, "storybeat_id": "storybeat_987654" },
      { "order": 1, "storybeat_id": "storybeat_654321" }
    ]
  }
]
```

---

## Why This Split Matters
| **Subtext** | **Storytelling** |
|-------------|----------------|
| Represents **deep narrative structure** | Represents **surface-level presentation** |
| Focuses on **author's intent** | Focuses on **audience appreciation** |
| Structural elements: **Perspectives, Players, Storypoints, Storybeats, Dynamics** | Expressive elements: **Overviews, Moments** |
| Determines the **underlying meaning** | Determines **how the story is told** |

## **Canonical Standards & Custom Mapping**  

The **Universal Narrative Model JSON Schema** provides a **canonical set of values** for `appreciation`, `method`, `dynamic`, and `vector` ensuring consistency across different implementations. However, we recognize that different storytelling frameworks (such as **Dramatica, Hero’s Journey, or Save the Cat!**) may use alternative terminology to describe similar concepts.  

To maintain **compatibility** while allowing **customization**, we introduce:  

- **Canonical Standards** – A predefined list of `appreciation`, `method`, `dynamic`, and `vector` values that form the foundation of the model and convey the meaning of the narrative.  
- **Custom Mapping Fields** – Optional fields (`custom_appreciation`, `custom_method`, `custom_dynamic`, `custom_vector`) for alternative terms.  
- **Namespacing for Third-Party Mappings** – The ability to link terminology from other frameworks via `custom_appreciation_namespace`, `custom_method_namespace`, `custom_dynamic_namespace`, and `custom_vector_namespace`.  

**Base Set** 

**Validation Rule:** Any `appreciation`, `method`, `dynamic`, or `vector` **must match** one of the below unless explicitly mapped via the **custom mapping system** for compliance with the Universal Narrative Model:

---

### Appreciations

```json
"appreciation": {
  "type": "string",
  "enum": [
    "Domain",
    "Concern",
    "Issue",
    "Problem",

### Storybeats
The following standardized values ensure consistency and interoperability in story structure:

#### Scope-Based Number Ranges

In a Storybeat, `scope` determines the range of `number`:

| **Scope** | **Allowed Range** |
|------------|-----------------|
| **Transit** | `1-4` |
| **Progression** | `1-16` |
| **Event** | `1-64` |

#### Canonical Tone Categories

Each Storybeat has **three tonal layers**:
| **Tone Type**  | **Enum Options** |
|---------------|-----------------|
| **Abstraction** | `"situation"`, `"action"`, `"justification"`, `"opinion"` |
| **Spatial** | `"potential"`, `"resistance"`, `"current"`, `"power"` |
| **Temporal** | `"expression"`, `"experimentation"`, `"integration"`, `"transcendence"` |

  "storytelling": "In the rain, Alex stares at the old photo, lost in thought.",
  "tones": {
    "abstraction": "justification",
    "spatial": "potential",
    "temporal": "expression"

```
✅ **Passes validation** because `number: 3` is within the **1-4 range** for `Transit`.

**Invalid Transit**

```json
{
  "id": "storybeat_abc123",
  "appreciation": "Transit",
  "number": 7,  
  "method": "Reflection",
  "illustration": "Looking back at choices made.",
  "summary": "A moment of hesitation as the protagonist considers the past.",
  "storytelling": "In the rain, Alex stares at the old photo, lost in thought.",
  "tones": {
    "abstraction": "justification",
    "spatial": "potential",
    "temporal": "expression"
  },
  "perspective_id": "perspective_xyz789"
}
```
❌ **Fails validation** because `number: 7` is **outside the allowed range (1-4)** for `Transit`.

---

### Custom Mapping Fields
If a user wants to use **alternative terminology**, they must define their custom term in **`custom_appreciation`**, **`custom_method`**, `**custom_dynamic**`, or **`custom_vector`** while still mapping it to an official term. If custom, they still must include the standard canonical item for consistent interoperability.

#### **Example: Custom Storypoint Mapping**  
A Storypoint using:  
- `appreciation`: **Objective Story Domain** (standard)  
- `method`: **Environmental Framing** (standard)  
- **Dramatica equivalent:**  
  - `custom_appreciation`: **Overall Story Domain**  
  - `custom_method`: **Situation**  

```json
"storypoints": [
  {
    "id": "storypoint_2345abcd",
    "appreciation": "Objective Story Domain",
    "method": "Environmental Framing",
    "illustration": "The world’s constraints define the struggle.",
    "summary": "The objective reality of the story world shapes the conflict.",
    "storytelling": "A citywide blackout forces the protagonist into an unexpected confrontation.",
    "perspective_id": "perspective_1234abcd",
    "custom_appreciation": "Overall Story Domain",
    "custom_method": "Situation"
  }
]
```

---

### Namespacing for Third-Party Mapping  
To support **multi-framework interoperability**, we introduce **namespaced mapping fields**:

```json
"custom_appreciation_namespace": {
  "Dramatica": "Overall Story Domain"
},
"custom_method_namespace": {
  "Dramatica": "Situation"
}
```

---

### Example: Storybeat Mapping
A Storybeat with:  
- `appreciation`: **Obstacle Character Transit 2**  
- `method`: **Preconscious**  
- **Dramatica equivalent:**  
  - `custom_appreciation`: **Influence Character Signpost 2**  
  - `custom_method`: **Impulsive Responses**  

```json
"storybeats": [
  {
    "id": "storybeat_9876bcde",
    "appreciation": "Obstacle Character Transit 2",
    "method": "Preconscious",
    "illustration": "The Obstacle Character’s unfiltered instincts create tension.",
    "summary": "The second major shift in the Obstacle Character’s development.",
    "storytelling": "A heated argument reveals the deep-seated fears that drive their opposition.",
    "perspective_id": "perspective_ab12cd34",
    "scope": "transit",
    "number": 2,
    "tones": {
        "abstraction": "justification",
        "spatial": "potential",
        "temporal": "expression"
    },
    "custom_appreciation": "Influence Character Signpost 2",
    "custom_method": "Impulsive Responses",
    "custom_appreciation_namespace": {
      "Dramatica": "Influence Character Signpost 2"
    },
    "custom_method_namespace": {
      "Dramatica": "Impulsive Responses"
    }
  }
]
```

## Summary of Canonical Standards & Custom Mapping
| Feature | Purpose | Implementation |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| **Canonical Standards** | Ensures interoperability | `appreciation`, `method`, `dynamic`, and `vector` enums |
| **Custom Mapping** | Allows alternative terminology | `custom_appreciation`, `custom_method`, `custom_dynamic`, `custom_vector` |
| **Namespacing** | Supports multi-framework compatibility | `custom_appreciation_namespace`, `custom_method_namespace`, `custom_vector_namespace` |

---

## Validation Rules
- A Storypoint or Storybeat must always use a standard `appreciation` and `method` unless mapped to a known alternative. Dynamics must map to a standard `dynamic` and `vector`.
- Storypoints and Storybeats must relate to a Perspective in one of the Four Throughlines. Dynamics are not attributed to a single Perspective.
- If using custom terms, they must map back to an existing Appreciation, Method, Dynamic, or Vector. 
- Namespacing should be used for cross-framework compatibility. 

---

## Extending the Model

### Custom Appreciations & Methods
To allow **flexibility**, users can **define their own terms**.

```json
"custom_appreciation": "Hero's Catalyst",
"custom_method": "Spiritual Awakening"
```
These should be **mapped** to the closest standard appreciation.
