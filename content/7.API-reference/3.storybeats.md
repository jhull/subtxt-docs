# Storybeat Completion

## Analyze Narrative Progression within Subtxt

The **Storybeat Completion** endpoint enables writers and developers to verify the completion status of narrative movements (storybeats) within a specific family. By matching the input storytelling text against the child storybeats of a parent storybeat, the endpoint determines whether all necessary storybeats are fulfilled. This provides a seamless way to monitor narrative progress and guide storytelling in alignment with Subtxt's structured framework.

---

## Using the Storybeat Completion Endpoint

To evaluate the completion of storybeats within a family, submit a POST request to the `storybeat/completion` endpoint. This request requires specifying the structure and parent storybeat IDs, along with the narrative text to check against child storybeats.

The endpoint will return `true` if all child storybeats of the given parent storybeat are satisfied, or `false` otherwise.
